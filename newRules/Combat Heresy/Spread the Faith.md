Players now Earn Faith dice of their Respective Faith (and Gold if Catholic before the Catholic Reformation) based on the Round # and their total Saints.

Catholics:

Intercession of the Saints: 1 Faith per Saint.
Sale of Indulgences: Gain 1 Gold before The Catholic Reformation
Ora et Labora: Gain 2 Good Works if you still have your Monastery Token.

Protestants:

Down with The Whore of Babylon: 5 Faith Rounds 1-3
The Jesuits Strike Back: 3 Faith Rounds 4-5

Catholics and Protestants:

Zeal: +2 Faith for those saved by Faith and Works or Faith Alone.
Imperial Sanction: +2 Faith for adherents of the Emperor's Religion.
Church Patronage: Players may turn Gold into Faith at a rate of 1 Gold:2 Faith.

After Players have earned their Faith/Gold, Players decide whether to use Church Patronage secretly and simultaneously. Then Players Spread the Faith; roll all of your Faith dice. Each Cross/Crucifix rolled is a success for Protestants/Catholics respectively.

Salvation Race - Catholics gain 1 Good Work token for each Crucifix, which they mark on their Good Works Die, trading it in for 1 Saint every time they get 5 Good Works.

Players then, in Initiative Order, place all of their successful dice on provinces of their choice, defensively or offensively. Dice may be placed:

In any of your own provinces;

On any Principality or Player-province within a contiguous chain of provinces of your religion that flows from your capital;

On any Principality or Player-province one hex beyond this chain of contiguous provinces of your religion that flows from your capital.

Church Abuses: Before the Council of Trent concludes, Catholics may not place their Faith Dice in Protestant Provinces or Principalities.

Whenever a Player places a die on a Principality with a dice of the opposing Faith, both dice are removed; place a Religious Upheaval Token on the Principality's Capital to indicate its eligibility to be a Target Principality. Once all Players have placed their dice: provinces/Principalities convert:

A Principality converts if as many are on it as the Principality has provinces. If not enough dice were placed, the Principality does not convert.

Dice of your own religion on your provinces cancel up to 2 dice of the opposing religion placed on the same province. Remove all canceled dice. Dice of an opposing religion remaining then convert the province they are on, except Player capitals.

For each town of yours that converts to the opposing religion, lose 2 Gold. In addition, lose 2 Gold if you have any opposing dice remaining on your capital.
