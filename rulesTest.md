# The Peace of Westphalia

The year is 1510. You are a Prince or Princess in the Holy Roman Empire.

And it's about to go down.

The Catholic Church is mired in corruption and scandal, and judgment has come for Her sins in the form of a young friar by the name of Martin Luther. Players must choose sides in the ensuing religious struggle:

Will you stick with the Catholic Church, attempt to reform the Church from within, and struggle from behind to win back the souls of the German people?
Or will you join the Protestant Revolutionaries and strive to rid the Whore of Babylon's influence from the land?
Will you seek ye first the kingdom, or subordinate faith to power politics?

Lead your principality through this turbulent time period. As Europe's religious firestorm culminates in the cataclysmic 30 Years War, will the One True Faith triumph? Or will religious divisions become entrenched in the Peace of Westphalia?

## How to Win

Victory can be achieved in one of three ways:

### Catholic Victory

If: At any point starting after the Religious War Phase of Round 4:

- There are more Catholic provinces than Protestant ones
- All Electors are Catholic 
- The Emperor is Catholic

The Catholic players with the most Saints are saved by Faith and Works and win; 2 players in a 5-6 player game, or 3 players in a 7-8 player game. In the case of a tie, more players may win by tying for the last spot.

### Protestant Victory

If: At any point starting after the Religious War Phase of Round 4:

- There are more Protestant provinces than Catholic ones
- All Electors are Protestant
- The Emperor is Protestant

The Protestant players with the most Reformation Points are saved by Faith Alone and win; 2 players in a 5-6 player game, or 3 players in a 7-8 player game. In the case of a tie, more players may win by tying for the last spot.

### Peace of Westphalia Victory

If: After Round 6, there was neither a Catholic nor a Protestant Victory:

Subtract all Imperial Power contributed by Foreign Power Home Provinces. Then each player adds 3 Imperial Power for each orthodox province they own. The player with the most Imperial Power wins. In cases of ties, the winner is chosen from among the tied players by the Emperor. 

## Setup

### Pick a Color

Pick a color and take your hex and cubes.

### Collect an Elector and a Principality

Pick a hex of an Elector and of a Principality.

### Determine Initiative

Give one of your cubes a player. If you are the player everyone gave a cube to then collect the player cubes into your hand and randomly draw them out of your hand to determine initiative order. 

### Place Hexes

Take turns placing your hex, an Elector hex, and a Principality hex until all players have placed their hexes. If you are the first player in initiative order take the first turn. To begin, place a hex in the center between all players. Place each subsequent hex adjacent to two other hexes if you are able.

### Place Province Dice on Hexes

Place a single yellow Catholic province die on each of the hexes in play. 

Set the number on the die of each player hex to three for three Catholic provinces.

Set the number on the die of the following Electors to the following:

Trier, Mainz, and Cologne - 1 Provinces

The Palatinate and Saxony - 2 Provinces

Brandenburg - 3 Provinces

Bohemia - 4 Provinces

For each Prince, roll a die. Use the result to set the number of provinces.

1-4: 	2 Provinces

5-6: 	3 Provinces

### Place Diplomatic Influence

Collect 3 Diplomatic Influence cubes of your color. Take turns, using initiative, distributing your Diplomatic Influence cubes onto the Princes and Electors in play. Win control over all Princes and Electors where you have equal to or more Influence there than they have total provinces. When more than one player has adequate Influence, win control if you have the most Infleunce there. You must spend all of your Influence.

### Elect the Emperor

Elect the Emperor according to the Imperial Election rules.

### Imperial Power and Saints

Set your Imperial Power to four and your Saints to 0 on your black and white dice. Update each Player's Imperial Power as it changes throughout the game. 

## Imperial Power

A Player has 1 Imperial Power for each of his orthodox provinces, plus the Imperial Power of their vassal Principalities. 

Principalities have 2 Imperial Power, plus 1 Imperial Power per province.

## How to Play

The game lasts 6 rounds between the years 1510-1660 with each Round lasting ~25 years. Each Round, determine Initiative and then do the Religious Upheaval, Combat Heresy, Engage in Diplomacy, and Wage War phases.

### Determine Initiative

The Emperor is always first, followed by Players ordered from weakest to strongest according to their Imperial Power, with ties resolved clockwise from the Emperor. Place control markers marking this Initiative Order.

### Religious Upheaval

Every round, convert random Principalities to Protestantism.

During Rounds 1-3:

Place 1 control marker for each Catholic Principality inside the Religious Upheaval Bag. Draw 2 control markers in a 5-6 Player game, 3 in a 7-8 Player game. 

All provinces from drawn Principalities convert to Protestantism. Replace their Catholic provinces die with a Protestant die.

Each Catholic non-Foreign Power Player rolls a D6. On a 1-3, one of the Player's provinces of his choice converts to Protestantism. For every Catholic province converted, lose a point on your Catholic die and add a point to your Protestant die. You cannot lose your last point on dice that is your religions as it only converts when the Player converts.

During Rounds 4-6: 

Put a control marker from every Principality into the Religious Upheaval Bag. Draw 2 control markers in a 5-6 Player game, 3 in a 7-8 Player game. If a drawn Principality is 1 province, it converts. If 2+ provinces, roll a D6; it converts on a 1-3.

Do Princes convert back to Catholic? 

### Combat Heresy

#### Player Conversion

All Players begin the game Catholic. All Non-Foreign Power Players Combatting Heresy have an opportunity to convert; they put their fists in the middle, and on a countdown of 3, 2, 1, show, Players show their thumbs up if they wish to convert. 

Players convert in Initiative Order, and upon conversion:

Blood of the Martyrs - Except for Martin Luther and St. Francis de Sales, when you convert you gain however many Saints or Reformation Points the Player with the least has who is still saved, -2. May not go negative.

Martin Luther/St. Francis de Sales - The first Player to convert to Protestantism gains 6 Reformation Points. If no Catholics remain, the first Player to return to Catholicism gains 6 Saints.

#### Spread the Faith

Whenever a Player places a dice on a province with a dice of the opposing Faith, both dice are removed. Once all Players have placed their dice, provinces/Principalities convert:

Within their own territory - Dice of your religion placed on heretical provinces you control convert the province they're on, and an additional heretical province of your choice that you control that does not have a heretical dice on it.

In a neighboring Player-controlled province - Dice placed on heretical provinces of opposing Players convert the province they were placed on.

On a neighboring or allied Principality - Dice placed on Principalities convert the entire Principality if as many are on it as the Principality has provinces.

### Engage in Diplomacy

#### Play the Diplomacy Game

First, in Initiative Order, all Players Engaging in Diplomacy play the Diplomacy Game with the Player after you in Initiative Order (or the first Player if you are last). Take your Dilemma cards. Counting down from 3, 2, 1, until "Go," show either a Cooperate or Compete card and take the Influence listed on the card.

Unplaced Diplomatic Influence is stored on your capital. You may not move Diplomatic Influence between Principalities once placed. You may remove all (never only some) of your Diplomatic Influence at any time to prevent yourself from joining an allied Principality in war, or for any reason whatsoever. This influence goes back to the supply.

#### Wage War

#### Setting the Warfare Stage

In Initiative Order, each Player Waging War may do any or all of the following things.

When all Players Waging War have had an opportunity to Declare Wars, proceed to Battles & Peace Treaties. The Religious War, if any, will be waged in the next phase.

##### Declare War on either an eligible Player or an unaligned Principality.

If you do not want to Declare War, you may pass.

When a war is declared, place both Players, or the Player and the unaligned Principality in the First Battle Phase, in the order the war was declared. If either the Player or the Principality is already in the First Battle Phase, place them in the Second Battle Phase, in the order the war was declared. Likewise for the Third Battle Phase.

#### Declare a Religious War

If a Religious War has not yet been Declared, a Player in a League saved by Faith Alone or Faith and Works (including Foreign Powers, even if they have no provinces or allies in the Empire) may Declare a Religious War against a heretical Target Principality.

Only the following are eligible as Target Principalities:

Those drawn during Religious Upheaval

A Principality you have enough Diplomatic Influence to ally, and:
Are its ally, or;
Are within 2 Diplomatic Influence of being its ally (no ties).

When a Religious War is Declared, the Declarer becomes the Restorer of The Faith (ROTF). Place his control marker in the corresponding slot. Do not remove any of his influence from the Target Principality.

#### Battles & Peace Treaties

Complete all battles in the First Battle Phase, then sign Peace Treaties in the order Players were placed in a Battle Phase. Then complete all battles in the Second Battle Phase followed by Peace Treaties. Likewise for a Third Battle Phase. If a Player or Principality is eliminated before a battle, that battle does not occur.

#### Religious War

##### Religious War

If no Religious War was Triggered, or if the Target Principality no longer exists, proceed to Tradeoffs.

If a Religious War was Triggered and the Target Principality still exists:

First, go through all Players with Diplomatic Influence on the Target Principality who aren't currently in a League from the Player with the most DI to the least. Players with DI on the Target Principality must Join a League (either one) or lose all DI with the Target Principality.

Second, if the Emperor is not yet a member of a League, he may Join a League.

Finally, the Player with the most DI on the Target Principality in the DOTF's League becomes the DOTF. If no Players in the DOTF's League have DI with the Target Principality, the Player first in Initiative Order becomes the DOTF. The DOTF gains DI with the Target Principality sufficient to become its ally if not already.

If there is no DOTF, the ROTF's League wins; proceed to the Religious War Peace Treaty phase. If there is a DOTF, all members in the Catholic League go to war with all members in the Evangelical League.

##### Religious War Battle

First, as during Wage War, each Player participating in the Religious War draws Military Cards according to his Imperial Power, and may discard and draw additional cards.

Then the Leagues fight, following the standard rules for battle except:

Players fight separately with as many Players as possible fighting at once.

Players line up in Initiative Order by League and pair off, with those without opponents "In Reserve."

Players only route when they run out of infantry in the face of a cavalry charge or only have cavalry when stopped by pikemen; they do not route if they have ½ as many Military Cards as their opponent after a cavalry charge, unless you are the last Player remaining in your League and the opposing League combined has 2x the Military Cards as you after you lose a cavalry charge.

When a Player routes, he exits the melee. The victorious Player's army does not return to full strength after winning the engagement, but instead either immediately begins to battle the Player first up "In Reserve" in the opposing League or, if there are no Players "In Reserve" in the opposing League, gets in line "In Reserve."

##### Religious War Peace Treaty

After the battle, if the ROTF's League:
Won, then the Target Principality is forcibly converted. All Players in the DOTF's League immediately lose all Diplomatic Influence with the Target Principality. The ROTF then gains 2 Diplomatic Influence with the Target Principality. The Target Principality may neither take provinces nor have its provinces taken in the Peace Treaty. Its ally, if any, therefore will not lose any influence with the Target Principality.
Lost, then the Target Principality retains its religion. All Players in the ROTF's League immediately lose all Diplomatic Influence with the Target Principality. The DOTF then gains 2 Diplomatic Influence with the Target Principality. The Target Principality may take provinces in the Peace Treaty as normal.

Next, if the Emperor was in the League of his religion and he:

Won, then he may remove any number of heretical Electors who fought in the Defeated League from the Electorate, replacing them with Electors of his choice of his own religion.
Lost, then the Player(s) of the opposing League with the most Imperial Power may remove any number of Electors of the Emperor's religion who fought in the Defeated League from the Electorate, replacing them with Electors of his (their) choice of the opposing Religion. Initiative Order in the case of ties.

Finally, members of the Victorious League, in Initiative Order, may conquer provinces from the Defeated League. Players do not lose Diplomatic Influence for taking towns and non-adjacent provinces. Otherwise, the rules for Peace Treaties in Religious Wars are exactly the same as those during Player Turns
The Leagues reset - No one starts in either League heading into the next round.
