- Pick who goes first. Turn order proceeds clockwise.

- Starting with the first player and proceeding clockwise, place 3 of your hexes on the board in a clover shape or a C-shape adjacent to existing tiles if there are any with the Gold Catholic side facing up. Then place an Elector (if there are any remaining) of choice adjacent to existing tiles contiguously in any shape with the Gold Catholic side facing up. Place an elector token on each Elector on the Gold Catholic side.

Place Electors in this order:
Trier, Mainz, and Cologne - 1 province
The Palatinate and Saxony - 2 provinces
Brandenburg - 3 provinces
Bohemia - 4 provinces

- After placing all starting Electors, continuing clockwise, begin placing one non-elector Principality at a time until you run out of Principalities. First place a 1 province Principality, then a 2 province Principality, then 3 Province Principality. 

- Return unused Principality hexes to the box. 

- Take 4 Influence cubes of your color and store them apart from your pool of Influence cubes. There is no max to Influence.

- Take your set of Action cards. Keep them face up for reference.

## How to Play

In Peace of Westphalia, take turns affecting the political, military, and religious landscape of Europe in order to win either a Religious or Military victory. The game lasts until the Emperor dies due an event card for a 5th time. 

Begin with the player who took the first turn in setup.

During your turn, draw an Event card and take an Action. First, apply the effect the Event card indicates, such as the Council of Trent event, then take an action, such as declaring a war. Choose which action from among your hand of action cards. Note that many actions have requirements, such as being Saved or being a specific religion. 

Action cards are always available for use even if you used them last turn. Because the Asset card options are static, there is no hand size. 

## How to Win

Win Peace of Westphalia through a Religious Victory or a Military Victory.

### Religious Victory

To win a Religious victory, your religion must meet the following requirements:

- More than half the provinces are your religion

- Four or more Electors are your religion

- The Emperor is your religion

- You must be Saved

### Military Victory

If a Religious Victory did not occur, then the player with the most Power wins. For every province with the correct religion add 1 Power to your total. Gain Power from your allies as well. In the case of a tie, the Emperor chooses the winner from among the tied players. 

## Game Mechanics

### Power

Power represents your military might. You gain 1 Power for each province with the correct religion you control directly or through your allies. Track your total Power on your Player Board. Power is used to raise troops during war and contributes towards a Military victory.

### Influence

Gain Influence by playing the Diplomacy Game against other players and spend it to turn non-player princes into allies. Allies increase your Power and, if they are Electors, gain you votes in Imperial Elections.

#### The Diplomacy Game

Face your opponent and count down '3, 2, 1, 'Go!' and simultaneously form either a thumbs up or a finger gun:

- If both Players formed a thumbs up, both Player gain 2 Influence.
- If one Player formed a thumbs up, while the other formed a finger gun, the Player with the finger gun gains 4 Influence and the other Player gain 0 Influence.
- If both Players formed a finger gun, both Players gain 1 Influence.

### Faith

Players gain faith dice through religious abilities, which they can roll and place on provinces to attempt to convert them to your religion. The number of provinces with the correct religion contributes towards a Religious Victory and your Power. During Mass events, these dice are resolved - if enough dice are present, they can convert provinces and principalities to your religion, though opposing dice cancel each other out. 

#### Faith Dice Placement Rules

You may only place Faith dice:

- In any of your own provinces
- On any Principality or Player-province within a contiguous chain of provinces of your religion that flows from your provinces
- On any Principality or Player-province one hex beyond this chain of contiguous provinces of your religion that flows from your provinces.

### Saved vs Damned

All Players start with their role on Damned Catholic, but may change to Saved either as Catholics or Protestant as the game goes on.

Catholics who control the most Catholic allies are considered Saved by Faith and Works. Count allies as follows:
- 1 province principality = 1 point
- 2-3 province principality = 2 points
- 4 province principality = 3 points

Only the top 2 Catholics in a 5-6 player game, or top 3 in a 7-8 player game, are Saved. Whenever ally control changes, recount the Catholic ally points to see who is Saved.

The first 2 Players (3 in a 7-8 Player game) to respond to God's irresistible grace and convert to Protestantism are Saved by Faith Alone. Once Saved Always Saved - there is nothing you can do to lose this role except by returning to Catholicism. If you convert back to Catholicism, the next Damned Protestant becomes Saved. If there are no other Protestants, the next Player to convert to Protestantism becomes Saved.

## Imperial Election

The Emperor affects the outcome of Religious Wars, the strength of conversions, and has bonus Power.

When the Emperor dies, hold an Imperial Election. The Emperor is elected by the 7 Electors of the Holy Roman Empire. These start as the 7 historical Electors of this time period - Trier, Mainz, Cologne, Saxony, The Palatinate, Brandenburg, and Bohemia. Throughout the game different Principalities may become Electors, but a Player may never become an Elector. 

### Voting for Emperor

As the player allied to an Elector, choose who they vote for. You may vote for yourself or another player. You may vote for players of a different religion than you or the Elector you control. You may only vote for players to become Emperor.  

Become Emperor if you secure the votes of a majority (4) of the Electors. Unaligned Electors vote as a block for the player of Elector's religion with the most votes after all players have voted. Use turn order to break ties. If a majority cannot be secured, the Emperor is elected by whoever gets the most votes of the players.

As Emperor, take the Emperor token and 2 free Influence.

You may not refuse election or re-election.

## Combat

### Resolving a War

#### Draw Cards

Win automatically without drawing Military Cards if possessing 2x the Power of the opponent. Draw a random Military Card for each Power. If you have more than 12 troops, pick cards and discard them until you have only 12 cards.

#### Fight

Place cards face-down, then flip them face-up simultaneously. If cards match, discard both in separate discard piles next to respective Players. If cards differ:

Pikemen vs. Cavalry - Discard the Cavalry and return the Pikeman to owner's hand. Prohibit the Cavalry player from playing Cavalry next round. Route if only Cavalry remain.

Musketeers vs. Pikemen - Discard the Pike and return the Musket to owner's hand.

Cavalry vs. Musketeers - Discard the Musket and return the Cavalry to owner's hand. Force the Musketeer player to discard 2 additional infantry (Pikemen or Musketeers) cards of choice. Route if unable to discard 2 infantry cards. Route the Musketeer player if the Cavalry player holds 2x the cards.

Call for Reinforcements - Draw from respective discard pile up to Reinforcement Marker value after any battle round. Select and reveal drawn cards to opponent. Limit draws to available cards in discard pile regardless of Reinforcement value. Call for Reinforcements once per battle only. Discard your Reinforcement marker.

Route if running out of cards. Lose battle upon routing, regardless of Reinforcement status. Declare battle Inconclusive if both Players exhaust cards simultaneously.

#### Peace Treaty

##### Inconclusive
Sign a White Peace upon inconclusive battle. Take no provinces. Maintain all influence with allies.

##### Lose
Upon defeat, submit to opponent's chosen territories or vassalization. Remove 1 Influence from each ally per province they lost.

##### Win

Upon victory, choose one of these three options:
- Conquer Territory
- Vassalize

Note these restrictions:
- Vassalize Electors and Target Principalities rather than conquering them completely
- Remove all Influence from conquered Principalities
- You cannot take a player's last province.
- Remove all personal Influence from Principalities when taking their province (allies' actions do not trigger this)
- Convert provinces forcibly when conquering provinces of different religion
- Upon tied Influence after Influence removal, grant alliance to the Player first in turn order if neither Player is currently allied

###### Conquer Territory
Take up to 2 Provinces from unaligned Principality(ies) or the Player and allies. 

###### Vassalize
Take control of a 1-2 Province Principality. Maintain/Replace control markers accordingly. Remove all other Players' Influence from the Principality. Place 2 Influence to establish alliance.

After choosing one option, grant each ally permission to take 1 adjacent province from unaligned Principality or the Player and allies. Restrict Principalities to 4 provinces maximum.

### Religious Wars

When a Religious War is declared, in turn order starting with the player after the Declarer, join a League or Remain Neutral. As a Saved player, you can only join the League corresponding to your religion.

A principality is considered involved in the war if it is the target of the Religious War or is an ally of a player who declared League membership before you did. 

Upon joining a League, remove all Influence with princes of the opposite faith, both in and outside the war.

Upon Remaining Neutral, remove all Influence with princes involved in the war at the present moment.

Grant Influence to the Player with highest Influence (turn order for ties) with each respective Target Principality in its League sufficient to become its ally, if not allied already. If no Players in the Target's League have Influence, grant alliance to the first Player in turn order in that League.

If there are no players in the opposing League, declare the Religious War Declarer the automatic victor and proceed to the Peace Treaty. With Players on both sides, commence war between all Catholic League members and all Evangelical League members; proceed to Battle phase.

#### Resolving Religious War Battles

Follow standard battle rules with these modifications:

After drawing Military Cards, Players separate into their Leagues and line up in turn order. Order the Influence cubes to keep track of battle order.

Pair off Players to fight simultaneously in turn order. Match Players from opposing Leagues. Unpaired Players wait for their turn. Multiple battles occur at the same time.

A Player routes when they run out of infantry against a cavalry charge, have only cavalry remaining against pikemen, or are the last League Player and have half or fewer Military Cards compared to the combined opposing League after losing to a cavalry charge.

As the victor of a battle in a religious war, keep track of the number of cards you had at the end of the battle. Enter the next battle by drawing new random military cards for every card you left the last battle with.

#### Concluding the Religious War

Remove all Religious Upheaval Markers.

For Defeated Principalities:
Remove all Influence from Defeated League Players. Convert all defeated Target Principalities to the victor's religion. Grant the Religious War Declarer sufficient Influence for alliance with converted principalities.

If the Emperor Participated:
Emperor Victory: Emperor may remove and replace Electors of opposing religion
Emperor Defeat: Anti-Imperial majority votes to remove and replace Electors of Emperor's religion

Victorious League members may conquer provinces from the Defeated League (in turn order). Target Principalities are protected from territorial changes. No Influence penalty for non-adjacent conquests. All other standard Peace Treaty rules apply.
