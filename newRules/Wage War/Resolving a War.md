# Fight

During battle Players play cards face-down, then flip them face-up. If the cards are the same, both are discarded in separate discard piles next to each respective Player. If the cards aren't the same:

Pikemen vs. Cavalry - Discard the Cavalry and return the Pikeman to its owner's hand. The player who played Cavalry may not play Cavalry again next round. If he only has Cavalry, he routes.

Musketeers vs. Pikemen - Discard the Pike and return the Musket to its owner's hand.
Advanced Rifling - Rounds 4-5 in addition, the Player who played the Pikeman must discard an additional card of his opponent's choice. If he does not have any more of that type of unit, he must say so. The Player who played Musketeers then chooses another unit type for his opponent to discard instead.

Cavalry vs. Musketeers - Discard the Musket and return the Cavalry to its owner's hand. The Player who played Musketeers discards an additional 2 infantry (Pikemen or Musketeers) cards of his choice from his hand. If he does not have 2 infantry cards to discard, he routes. In addition, if the Player who played Cavalry has 2x his opponent's cards, his opponent routes.

Call for Reinforcements - You may Call for Reinforcement after any round of battle; draw from your respective discard pile up to as many Military Cards as your Reinforcement Marker indicates. You may choose which cards you draw, and must show your opponent, but may not draw more than you have in the discard pile, even if you have more potential reinforcements. You may only Call for Reinforcements once per battle.

If a Player runs out of cards, he routes, in addition to the above possible routes. If a Player routes, he loses the battle, even if he has not Called for Reinforcements. If both Players run out of cards at the same time, the battle is Inconclusive.
