# Caps and Hammers

*The World Wars are over and the Cold War is here. Our enemies will stop at nothing to spread their evil to every corner of the world. We must foresee their every move, plan how best to use our assets, and discover how our assets combo together. The world will see that WE are on the right side of history.*

Win the game by collecting more Prestige than your opponent. Collect Prestige by winning Situations each round. Win a Situation by exerting more total Influence on it than your opponent. Exert Influence by deploying your Assets, which provide Influence, from your hand into the Situations on the board. At the end of the round, sum the Influence of each of your Assets on a Situation and take the Prestige of any Situations you won. Launch your Asset's unique abilities called Operations to help you win Situations. Use the unique rules of each Situation to draw closer to victory.

Win the game if you have more Prestige after the Situation deck runs out. Lose the game if you tie over Prestige, or win by more than 10 Prestige.

## Rounds

Caps and Hammers consists of three rounds. Each round, draw Assets and place four Situations. Then take turns deploying Assets and launching Operations. Win Situations and earn Prestige at the end of each Round.

### Situation Phase

Draw Asset cards until you have a hand of seven Assets. Always keep your hand hidden from your opponent.

Draw four Situations and place them face-up in a line between both players.

### Influence Phase

During the Influence Phase, take turns deploying Assets and launching Operations. Carefully distribute your limited Assets and their Operations to win Situations and gain Prestige. Take five turns each every round.

Take the First Turn card and first turn of the round if you have more Prestige than your opponent. If you, as the Caps player, have equal Prestige to the Hammers player, take the First Turn card and take the first turn.

Gain Influence on a Situation equal to the number in the top-left corner of each of your Assets. Win Situations by having more Influence on it than your opponent. Notice that many Assets have abilities called Operations. Launch the Asset's Operation to gain it's effect immediately. Note that End of the Round effects come into play no matter what at the end of the round.

#### Deploying an Asset

Take an Asset card from your hand and place it face-down in portrait orientation on your side of a Situation. You may deploy one, and only one, Asset per turn. You may not skip your turn. There is no limit to the number of Assets you may deploy to your side of a Situation. You may always look at your Asset cards, including face-down Assets in play.

#### Launching an Operation

To launch an Asset's Operation, turn a face-down Asset face-up into landscape orientation. The Operation then immediately takes effect. You may launch as many Operations as you want during your turn, before and after deploying an Asset. You may launch the Operation of an Asset on the turn you deployed it.

There are nine different types of Assets, each with unique abilities.

Note that the term 'here' in Asset abilities refers to the Situation and all Assets on that Situation.

### Resolution Phase

Once players have taken five turns each, take these steps:

#### 1. Reveal Hidden Assets

Flip all face-down Assets in play face-up into portrait orientation.

#### 2. Win Situations

Determine your Influence on a Situation by adding up the Influence of your Asset cards there. Gain Influence from your Asset cards regardless of whether you launched their Operations. Take into account your Assets' abilities.

Win every Situation where you have more Influence than your opponent. If both players have zero or equal Influence on a Situation, the Situation is a tie. Neither player wins tied Situations unless an effect breaks ties. If a card has a unique win condition, use that to determine the winner of the Situation instead of Infuence, as noted on the Situation.

Total the Prestige value from all the Situations you won. Add any other Prestige you got from the abilities you used.

Add the sum of Prestige you won this round and add it to your current Prestige total. Take denominations of Prestige cards to represent your new total.

Keep your Prestige tokens visible to your opponent.

#### 3. Reset

Discard all Situations in play.

Discard all your deployed Asset cards into your Asset discard pile. Â Keep the two Asset cards you didn't use this round in your hand.

If there are no more Situations left, determine the winner. Otherwise, begin the next round at the Situation phase.

## Determine the Winner

If you tie with your opponent for Prestige, Nuclear War occurs and everyone dies.

If you have ten or more Prestige more than your opponent, Nuclear War occurs and everyone dies.

Otherwise, if you have more Prestige than your opponent win Caps and Hammers.
