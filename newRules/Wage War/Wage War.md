Then, in Initiative Order, each Player may Declare War on one or more unaligned Principalities, against another Player, or declare a Religious War.

# Declare War Against One or More Unaligned Principalities

You must remove all of your Influence from the Principality(ies) and have at least twice the Imperial Power of all chosen Unaligned Principalities combined. You may pay 1 Gold for 1 Temporary IP in order to achieve this.

Immediately resolve the Peace Treaty before the next Player Declares War.

A Player may remove all of his Influence, which goes back to the supply, in order to avoid defending a now unaligned Principality.

# Declare War Against a Player

The Player may not have already been Declared War on. Place cubes from both Players in the First Battle Phase in the order the war was declared. If either Player is already in the First Battle Phase, place them in the Second Battle Phase. Likewise for the Third Battle Phase.

# [[Declare A Religious War]]

2. Battles & Peace Treaties

Complete all battles in the First Battle Phase, then sign Peace Treaties in the order Players were placed in a Battle Phase. Then complete all battles in the Second Battle Phase followed by Peace Treaties. Likewise for a Third Battle Phase. If a Player is eliminated before a battle, that battle/war does not occur. 

[[Resolving a War]] and then sign [[Peace Treaties]].

3. Post-War Diplomacy

At the end of Declare War, if you did not Declare a Religious War, lose one influence from each Principality that was an ally of yours throughout the entirety of Wage War that did not gain a province in a war with you, regardless of the reason, including if there were no eligible provinces or your ally was size 4.
