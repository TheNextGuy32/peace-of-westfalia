# The Peace of Westphalia

The year is 1510. You are a Prince or Princess in the Holy Roman Empire.

And it’s about to go down.

The Catholic Church is mired in corruption and scandal, and judgment has come for Her sins in the form of a young friar by the name of Martin Luther. Players must choose sides in the ensuing religious struggle:

Will you stick with the Catholic Church, attempt to reform the Church from within, and struggle from behind to win back the souls of the German people?
Or will you join the Protestant Revolutionaries and strive to rid the Whore of Babylon’s influence from the land?
Will you seek ye first the kingdom, or subordinate faith to power politics?

Lead your principality through this turbulent time period. As Europe’s religious firestorm culminates in the cataclysmic 30 Years War, will the One True Faith triumph? Or will religious divisions become entrenched in the Peace of Westphalia?

## How to Win

Victory can be achieved in one of three ways:

### Catholic Victory

If: At any point starting after the Religious War Phase of Round 4:

- There are more Catholic provinces than Protestant ones
- All Electors are Catholic 
- The Emperor is Catholic

The Catholic players with the most Saints are saved by Faith and Works and win; 2 players in a 5-6 player game, or 3 players in a 7-8 player game. In the case of a tie, more players may win by tying for the last spot.

### Protestant Victory

If: At any point starting after the Religious War Phase of Round 4:

- There are more Protestant provinces than Catholic ones
- All Electors are Protestant
- The Emperor is Protestant

The Protestant players with the most Reformation Points are saved by Faith Alone and win; 2 players in a 5-6 player game, or 3 players in a 7-8 player game. In the case of a tie, more players may win by tying for the last spot.

### Peace of Westphalia Victory

If: After Round 6, there was neither a Catholic nor a Protestant Victory:

Subtract all Imperial Power contributed by Foreign Power Home Provinces. Then each player adds 3 Imperial Power for each orthodox town they own. The player with the most Imperial Power wins. In cases of ties, the winner is chosen from among the tied players by the Emperor. 

## Terminology

Principality(ies) always refers to non-Player principalities unless stated.

Player(s) will always be used when referring to Players.

Orthodox means the same religion as the Player.

## Setup

### Lay out the Map

Lay out the map where all can see. The hex tiles that will be played with will be clearly marked, depending on how many Players are playing, with 9 tiles per Player.

### Arrange the Pieces

Place the Holy Roman Empire Sheet in a central location where everyone can clearly see it. Place the Catholic and Protestant Dice, as well as the Ottoman Dice, Principality Control Markers, Foreign Power Provinces, Protestant Provinces, military cards, and Principality towns within easy reach.

### Pick a Color and Flag

Each Player picks a set of control markers in the color and with the flag of their choice. 5 towns and a city of that player’s color should be included, as well as a Council of Trent Marker and French Interference Marker.

### Pick Provinces

Each Player submits a cube of their color. Randomly draw cubes for Setup Order. The First Player picks 4 provinces and places his control marker on them; three of these provinces must touch each other at a vertex and the entire principality must be contiguous. He then places a town on his chosen capital province. Other Players follow, in Setup Order.

### Place Electors

The First Player places an Elector of his choice anywhere on the map, and placing a town on the Elector’s capital province. The Elector’s provinces must be contiguous, unless impossible, but may be shaped however the Player desires. Other Players follow, in Setup Order, going back to the First Player at the end. The following starting Electors must be placed:

Trier, Mainz, and Cologne - 1 province

The Palatinate and Saxony - 2 provinces

Brandenburg - 3 provinces

Bohemia - 4 provinces

### Place other Principalities

After all starting Electors are placed, continuing in clockwise order, each Player rolls a D6. On a roll of a:

1-4: 	Place a 2 Province Principality

5-6: 	Place a 3 Province Principality

Pick a province where there is space on the board for a contiguous Principality of the rolled size and place the Principality’s town; this is its capital, and the rest of its provinces must border its capital if possible. If not possible, the Principality’s provinces simply need to be contiguous. If there is no space on the board for a contiguous Principality of the rolled size, place the largest Principality that can be placed. When only disconnected single provinces remain, fill in the remaining provinces with 1 province Principalities. Save Austria and Bavaria for if a Principality grows to more than 5 provinces.

### Place Diplomatic Influence

Each Player receives 3 Diplomatic Influence. The First Player places all of his Diplomatic Influence onto one or more Principalities of his choice. Other Players follow, in Setup Order. Players may not save their Diplomatic Influence during Setup.

### Elect the Emperor

Elect the Emperor according to the Imperial Election rules. Then place the Emperor’s control marker on 1510. Place each Player’s control marker on the Holy Roman Empire Sheet depending on his Imperial Power. The Emperor receives X+2 additional Imperial Power, where X = the Round Number.

### Choose a Military Doctrine

Each Player chooses a Military Doctrine in Setup Order, placing his cube there. The 7 available Military Doctrines are:

Flexible - an emphasis on flexibility

Defensive - an emphasis on pikemen

Offensive - an emphasis on musketeers and cavalry

Aristocratic - an emphasis on cavalry

Infantry - an emphasis on pikemen and musketeers

Traditional - an emphasis on pikemen and cavalry

Innovative - an emphasis on musketeers

### SET UP THE HOLY ROMAN EMPIRE SHEET

Place a cube from all Players in the Saved by Faith and Works box. Put a cube for all Players at 0 Saints. Place the Catholic marker at 7 Catholic Electors, and the Emperor’s religion at Catholic. Now let the games begin - proceed to Round 1.

### FUND THE MONASTERIES

Take a Monastery card and place two coins on it.

## How to Play

The game spans the years 1510-1660 and lasts 6 rounds, with each Round lasting ~25 years.

Update each Player’s Imperial Power as it changes throughout the game. A Player has 1 Imperial Power for each of his orthodox provinces, plus the Imperial Power of his allied Principalities. Principalities have 2 Imperial Power, plus 1 Imperial Power per province.

### Determine Initiative

Establish the Initiative Order for the Round, with the Emperor first, followed by Players ordered from weakest to strongest according to their Imperial Power, with ties resolved clockwise from the Emperor. Place control markers marking this Initiative Order.

### Religious Upheaval

All provinces start Catholic. Whenever a province converts between Catholicism and Protestantism, add or remove a Protestant province on the underlying Catholic province. After performing Religious Upheaval, place the drawn control markers near the Religious War section to indicate their eligibility to be a Target Principality.

During Rounds 1-3:

Place 1 control marker for each Catholic Principality inside the Religious Upheaval Bag. Draw 2 control markers in a 5-6 Player game, 3 in a 7-8 Player game. All provinces from drawn Principalities convert to Protestantism.

Each Catholic non-Foreign Power Player rolls a D6. On a 1-3, one of the Player’s provinces of his choice converts to Protestantism. A player’s capital may not be converted this way; it only converts when the Player converts.

During Rounds 4-6: 

Put a control marker from every Principality into the Religious Upheaval Bag. Draw 2 control markers in a 5-6 Player game, 3 in a 7-8 Player game. If a drawn Principality is 1 province, it converts. If 2+ provinces, roll a D6; it converts on a 1-3.

#### Earn Gold

Players earn 2 Gold for each town they own that is on an orthodox (the religion they adhere to) province. Players do not earn Gold for allied towns or towns on heretical provinces. The trading and/or gifting of resources (Gold, Faith, Diplomatic Influence) is prohibited. 

### Player Turns

Player turns are done in initiative order.

#### Choose whether to Combat Heresy, Engage in Diplomacy, or Wage War

During Player Turns, Players will choose 2/3 of Combat Heresy, Engage in Diplomacy, & Wage War, incurring Tradeoffs for the action they did not engage in.

#### Combat Heresy

At the beginning of Combat Heresy, all Players secretly either place a cube of their color in their hand or don’t. Players that reveal a cube place their cube in Combat Heresy and engage in the following actions in order. Players that did not reveal a cube place two of their cubes in Engage in Diplomacy and Wage War.

##### Player Conversion

All Players begin the game Catholic. All Non-Foreign Power Players Combatting Heresy have an opportunity to convert; they put their fists in the middle, and on a countdown of 3, 2, 1, show, Players show their thumbs up if they wish to convert. 

Players convert in Initiative Order, and upon conversion:

Blood of the Martyrs - Except for Martin Luther and St. Francis de Sales, when you convert you gain however many Saints or Reformation Points the Player with the least has who is still saved, -2. May not go negative.

Martin Luther/St. Francis de Sales - The first Player to convert to Protestantism gains 6 Reformation Points. If no Catholics remain, the first Player to return to Catholicism gains 6 Saints.

##### Call The Council of Trent

If the Catholic Reformation has not begun, attempt to Call the Council of Trent.

##### Spread the Faith

Whenever a Player places a dice on a province with a dice of the opposing Faith, both dice are removed. Once all Players have placed their dice, provinces/Principalities convert:

Within their own territory - Dice of your religion placed on heretical provinces you control convert the province they’re on, and an additional heretical province of your choice that you control that does not have a heretical dice on it.

In a neighboring Player-controlled province - Dice placed on heretical provinces of opposing Players convert the province they were placed on.

On a neighboring or allied Principality - Dice placed on Principalities convert the entire Principality if as many are on it as the Principality has provinces.

#### Engage in Diplomacy

At the beginning of Engage in Diplomacy, all Players that Combatted Heresy secretly either place a cube of their color in their hand or don’t. Players that reveal a cube place their cube in Engage in Diplomacy and engage in the following actions in order. Players that did not reveal a cube place their remaining cube in Wage War.

##### Play the Diplomacy Game

First, in Initiative Order, all Players Engaging in Diplomacy play the Diplomacy Game with the Player after you in Initiative Order (or the first Player if you are last). Take your Dilemma cards. Counting down from 3, 2, 1, until "Go," show either a Cooperate or Compete card and take the Influence listed on the card.

Unplaced Diplomatic Influence is stored on your capital. You may not move Diplomatic Influence between Principalities once placed. You may remove all (never only some) of your Diplomatic Influence at any time to prevent yourself from joining an allied Principality in war, or for any reason whatsoever. This influence goes back to the supply.

##### Diplomatic Actions

After all Players Engaging in Diplomacy have played the Diplomacy Game, in Initiative Order Players may do any number of the Diplomatic Action cards.

#### Wage War

##### Setting the Warfare Stage

In Initiative Order, each Player Waging War may do any or all of the following things.

When all Players Waging War have had an opportunity to Declare Wars and change their Military Doctrines, proceed to Battles & Peace Treaties. The Religious War, if any, will be waged in the next phase.

###### Declare War on either an eligible Player or an unaligned Principality.

If you do not want to Declare War, you may pass.

When a war is declared, place both Players, or the Player and the unaligned Principality in the First Battle Phase, in the order the war was declared. If either the Player or the Principality is already in the First Battle Phase, place them in the Second Battle Phase, in the order the war was declared. Likewise for the Third Battle Phase.

###### Join a League

Players may Join a League, as in Engaging in Diplomacy.

##### Declare a Religious War

If a Religious War has not yet been Declared, a Player in a League saved by Faith Alone or Faith and Works (including Foreign Powers, even if they have no provinces or allies in the Empire) may Declare a Religious War against a heretical Target Principality.

Only the following are eligible as Target Principalities:

Those drawn during Religious Upheaval

A Principality you have enough Diplomatic Influence to ally, and:
Are its ally, or;
Are within 2 Diplomatic Influence of being its ally (no ties).

When a Religious War is Declared, the Declarer becomes the Restorer of The Faith (ROTF). Place his control marker in the corresponding slot. Do not remove any of his influence from the Target Principality.

##### Battles & Peace Treaties

Complete all battles in the First Battle Phase, then sign Peace Treaties in the order Players were placed in a Battle Phase. Then complete all battles in the Second Battle Phase followed by Peace Treaties. Likewise for a Third Battle Phase. If a Player or Principality is eliminated before a battle, that battle does not occur.

###### Battles

When battling an unaligned Principality, the first Player after you in Initiative Order not participating in a battle at the moment leads them in battle. No collusion to battle poorly is allowed. Players pair off separately into their respective battles and fight simultaneously during the Battle Phase.

If a Player’s Army Size + Reserves is twice as large as an opponent’s, he wins the battle automatically without drawing Military Cards.

If not, Players randomly draw cards from the deck according to their Imperial Power - up to a max of 12 cards, with the rest of their Imperial Power going towards Reserves. After drawing Military Cards, Players may pay Gold to draw extra Military Cards of their choice at a rate of 1:1. In addition, Players may discard up to 2 cards faceup and draw replacements according to their Military Doctrines. Do these simultaneously unless a Player requests it be done in Initiative Order.

Military Doctrines:
Flexible - May discard any unit for any other unit

Defensive - May discard 1 musketeer or cavalry for 2 pikemen

Offensive - May discard 1 pikeman for 1 musketeer and 1 cavalry

Aristocratic - May discard 1 pikeman or musketeer for 2 cavalry

Infantry - May discard 1 cavalry for 1 pikeman and 1 musketeer

Traditional - May discard 1 musketeer for 1 pikeman and 1 cavalry

Innovative - May discard 1 pikeman or cavalry for 2 musketeers

During battle Players play cards face-down, then flip them face-up. If the cards are the same, both are discarded. If the cards pit:

Pikemen vs. Cavalry - Discard the Cavalry and return the Pikeman to its owner’s hand. The player who played Cavalry may not play Cavalry again next round. If he only has Cavalry, he routes.

Musketeers vs. Pikemen - Discard the Pike and return the Musket to its owner’s hand.
Advanced Rifling - Rounds 5-6 in addition, the Player who played the Pikeman must discard an additional card of his opponent’s choice. If he does not have any more of that type of unit, he must say so. The Player who played Musketeers then chooses another unit type for his opponent to discard instead.

Cavalry vs. Musketeers - Discard the Musket and return the Cavalry to its owner’s hand. The Player who played Musketeers discards an additional Pikeman and Musketeer from his hand. If he lacks one of the unit types he must say so and discard 2 of the infantry he does have instead. If he does not have 2 infantry cards to discard, he routes. In addition, if the Player who played Cavalry has 2x his opponent’s cards, his opponent routes.

Call for Reinforcements - After any round of battle a Player may Call for Reinforcements. He also may be forced to Call for Reinforcements by a route, or running out of cards. When Calling for Reinforcements, he draws from his battle discard pile as many Military Cards as his Imperial Power says he has reinforcements. The cards he draws are of his choice, but he may not draw more than he has cards in the discard pile, even if his Imperial Power says he gets more reinforcements. A Player may only Call for Reinforcements once during a battle.

If a Player runs out of cards or routes, he discards the rest of his cards and must call for his reinforcements. If he does not have reinforcements or has already called for reinforcements, he loses the battle. If both Players run out of cards and reinforcements, the battle is Inconclusive and the Players sign a White Peace; neither Player conquers provinces from the other or loses influence with allies

###### Peace Treaties

If you win:

Conquer 1 province with a town, or up to 2 provinces without one from the unaligned Principality or the Player and his allies.

For every town you take you lose 2 Diplomatic Influence.

For every province you take without a town that wasn’t adjacent at the start of your turn you lose 1 Diplomatic Influence, unless you’re the Emperor taking from a Foreign Power.

Additionally, your allies may each take 1 adjacent province from the unaligned Principality or the Player and his allies. Lose 2 Diplomatic Influence from each of your allies that could have conquered a province but did not (the ability to take a province is determined at the start of the war).

If you lose to a Player, they may do to you what you would have been able to do to them. If you lose to an unaligned Principality, it conquers two (one if only one available) non-town provinces of your choice from you and/or your allies. The provinces need not be adjacent to the unaligned Principality. If there are no eligible provinces for you to lose, then you are eliminated and become a Foreign Power if not already.

You lose 2 Diplomatic Influence with each of your allies per province they lost.

Additionally:

Only Players may conquer towns; remove all Diplomatic Influence from conquered Principalities. Capitals may only be taken if they are that Power’s last province.

You may choose to immediately vassalize a Principality (or former Player-owned capital) instead of taking it. Keep the Principality’s control marker on province (or replace the Player’s with a new Principality control marker). You lose no Diplomatic Influence for vassalizing; instead, remove all Diplomatic Influence from other Players from the Principality and place 2 Diplomatic Influence on the Principality; you are now its ally.

Electors may not be conquered and must be vassalized instead.

You lose all Diplomatic Influence from Principalities that you had Diplomatic Influence with when you personally (not an ally) take a province from them.

If a Principality conquers a province of a different religion, that province is forcibly converted to the Principality’s religion (No Saints/Reformation Points earned).

##### Religious War

###### Religious War Declared

If no Religious War was Triggered, or if the Target Principality no longer exists, proceed to Tradeoffs.

If a Religious War was Triggered and the Target Principality still exists:

First, go through all Players with Diplomatic Influence on the Target Principality who aren’t currently in a League from the Player with the most DI to the least. Players with DI on the Target Principality must Join a League (either one) or lose all DI with the Target Principality.

Second, if the Emperor is not yet a member of a League, he may Join a League.

Finally, the Player with the most DI on the Target Principality in the DOTF’s League becomes the DOTF. If no Players in the DOTF’s League have DI with the Target Principality, the Player first in Initiative Order becomes the DOTF. The DOTF gains DI with the Target Principality sufficient to become its ally if not already.

If there is no DOTF, the ROTF’s League wins; proceed to the Religious War Peace Treaty phase. If there is a DOTF, all members in the Catholic League go to war with all members in the Evangelical League.

###### Religious War Battle

First, as during Wage War, each Player participating in the Religious War draws Military Cards according to his Imperial Power, and may discard and draw additional cards according to his Military Doctrine and Gold spent.

Then the Leagues fight, following the standard rules for battle except:

Players fight separately with as many Players as possible fighting at once.

Players line up in Initiative Order by League and pair off, with those without opponents "In Reserve."

Players only route when they run out of infantry in the face of a cavalry charge or only have cavalry when stopped by pikemen; they do not route if they have ½ as many Military Cards as their opponent after a cavalry charge, unless you are the last Player remaining in your League and the opposing League combined has 2x the Military Cards as you after you lose a cavalry charge.

When a Player routes, he exits the melee. The victorious Player’s army does not return to full strength after winning the engagement, but instead either immediately begins to battle the Player first up "In Reserve" in the opposing League or, if there are no Players "In Reserve" in the opposing League, gets in line "In Reserve."

###### Religious War Peace Treaty

After the battle, if the ROTF’s League:
Won, then the Target Principality is forcibly converted. All Players in the DOTF’s League immediately lose all Diplomatic Influence with the Target Principality. The ROTF then gains 2 Diplomatic Influence with the Target Principality. The Target Principality may neither take provinces nor have its provinces taken in the Peace Treaty. Its ally, if any, therefore will not lose any influence with the Target Principality.
Lost, then the Target Principality retains its religion. All Players in the ROTF’s League immediately lose all Diplomatic Influence with the Target Principality. The DOTF then gains 2 Diplomatic Influence with the Target Principality. The Target Principality may take provinces in the Peace Treaty as normal.

Next, if the Emperor was in the League of his religion and he:

Won, then he may remove any number of heretical Electors who fought in the Defeated League from the Electorate, replacing them with Electors of his choice of his own religion.
Lost, then the Player(s) of the opposing League with the most Imperial Power may remove any number of Electors of the Emperor’s religion who fought in the Defeated League from the Electorate, replacing them with Electors of his (their) choice of the opposing Religion. Initiative Order in the case of ties.

Finally, members of the Victorious League, in Initiative Order, may conquer provinces from the Defeated League. Players do not lose Diplomatic Influence for taking towns and non-adjacent provinces. Otherwise, the rules for Peace Treaties in Religious Wars are exactly the same as those during Player Turns
The Leagues reset - No one starts in either League heading into the next round.

###### Tradeoffs

Players experience Tradeoffs depending on the choices made on their turns. Do simultaneously, unless a Player requests it be done in Initiative Order.
All remaining Gold turns into Diplomatic Influence at a rate of 1:1 (may be lost during Tradeoffs).

###### Foreign Powers

Any Player may become a Foreign Power if he owns no non-capital towns and: Rounds 1-3 has 5 Imperial Power or less, or Rounds 4-6 has 15 Imperial Power or less.

A Player who loses all of his provinces during the Round immediately becomes a Foreign Power. Remove the influence you lost due to the war, including any eliminated allies. Then complete steps 2-5 of Becoming a Foreign Power, but wait until the next Round before doing anything else.

Lose all provinces you possessed inside the Empire. If you had any provinces inside the Empire, these form one new Principality; swap all of your control markers on the board for control markers of the new Principality. Swap your city for a Principality town.

Turn all Gold into Diplomatic Influence at a rate of 1:1.

Count the Diplomatic Influence you have saved and on Principalities. Remove it all and give yourself back ½, rounding down.

Your Foreign Power is same Religion you were in the Empire, and you may not convert. Keep your Saints/Reformation Points. Faith dice may not be placed on your Home Province to convert it.

Choose a Foreign Power Home Province and place it next to one of the 6 edges of the map of your choice. You are not limited by the placement of other Foreign Power Home Provinces. Your Foreign Power Home Province is now adjacent to all provinces on that edge of the map for purposes of conversion and Peace Treaties. Your Foreign Power Home Province cannot be conquered. This province starts with a city and is your capital. It grants you 4 Imperial Power per Round #, - a roll of 2D6, rolled every Round.

Every Round each Foreign Power rolls 2D6 for "Internal Troubles and Wars Abroad." Subtract the result from the Imperial Power your Foreign Power Home Province provides next Round (it may not provide negative). Your provinces inside the HRE still provide Imperial Power.

###### Imperial Election

If the Emperor has been Emperor for one round only, roll a D6; he dies on a 3 or less. He dies automatically if he has been Emperor for two rounds, or left the Empire to become a Foreign Power. Hold an Imperial Election any round in which the Emperor dies.

The Emperor is elected by the 7 Electors of the Holy Roman Empire. These start as the 7 historical Electors of this time period - Trier, Mainz, Cologne, Saxony, The Palatinate, Brandenburg, and Bohemia. Throughout the game different Principalities may become Electors, but a Player may never become an Elector.

Players allied to Electors control their votes.

Only a Player may receive votes for Emperor.

Players may vote for whomever they wish, including themselves and Players of a different religion from themselves or the Electors whose votes they control. Any Player may become Emperor, including Foreign Powers.

A Player may not refuse election.

Players attempt to secure the votes of a majority of the Electors (4) to be elected Emperor. Unaligned Electors vote as a block for the Player of their religion with the most votes after all Players have voted. Initiative/Setup Order between tied Players. If a majority cannot be secured, the Emperor may be elected by a plurality.

Place the elected Emperor’s Control Marker on the Round Number.
