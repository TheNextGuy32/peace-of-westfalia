Depending on the result of [[Resolving a War]], do the following actions but keep in mind:
- Electors and the Target Principalities may not be completely conquered and must be vassalized instead.
- Remove all Diplomatic Influence from conquered Principalities.
- Capitals may only be taken if they are that Power's last province.
- You lose all Diplomatic Influence from Principalities that you had Diplomatic Influence with when you personally (not an ally) take a province from them.
- If a Principality conquers a province of a different religion, that province is forcibly converted to the Principality's religion (no Saints earned).
- If, as a result of a loss of DI, Players are tied for first in DI with a Principality, but neither is its ally, the Player first in Initiative Order immediately becomes its ally.
# Inconclusive
If the battle is inconclusive, sign a White Peace where neither Player conquers provinces from the other nor loses influence with their allies.
# Lose
If you lose, in addition to whatever your opponent takes or vassalizes, lose 1 Diplomatic Influence on each of your allies per province they lost.
# Win
If you win, you may choose between the following 3 options:
## Conquer Territory
Conquer 1 Town or up to 2 Provinces from the unaligned Principality(ies) or the Player and his allies. You are limited by the hexes included in the game. 

If you conquer any territory that was not adjacent to you at the start of the Battle, you lose 1 DI from each Principality you have DI with.

If you conquer a town, lose 1 DI from each Principality you have DI with. This Influence is lost after your allies have an opportunity to take provinces.
## Vassalize
Vassalize a 1-2 Province Principality or Player. Keep the Principality's control marker on province (or replace the Player's with a new Principality control marker). You lose no Diplomatic Influence for vassalizing; instead, remove all Diplomatic Influence from other Players from the Principality and place 2 Diplomatic Influence on the Principality; you are now its ally.

## Liberate a Principality 
Take a Player-controlled town or capital, and replace it with a new Principality. You start as its ally with 2 DI.

In addition to one of the above, each of your allies may take 1 adjacent province from the unaligned Principality or the Player and his allies. Principalities cannot grow past 4 provinces and cannot conquer towns.
