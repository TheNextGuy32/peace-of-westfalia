Players 'Saved' may Declare a Religious War against any eligible heretical Target Principality:

Principalities with a Religious Upheaval Marker on them not already made a Target Principality are eligible Target Principalities. Lift the Religious Upheaval Marker upright.

The Declarer joins either the Catholic or the Evangelical League, according to his Religion, placing a corresponding Faith Dice on his capital to signify this.

Do not remove any Influence from the Target Principality as in a Regular War.

When all Players Waging War have had an opportunity to Declare War, proceed to Battles & Peace Treaties. The Religious War, if any, will be waged in the next phase. Remove all non-upright Religious Upheaval Markers.
