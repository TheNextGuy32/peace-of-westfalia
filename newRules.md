How to Win

Victory can be achieved in one of three ways:

Catholic Victory
If: At any point starting after the Religious War Phase of Round 4:
There are more Catholic provinces than Protestant ones;
All Electors are Catholic; and
The Emperor is Catholic
Then: The Catholic players with the most Good Works are saved by Faith and Works and win; 2 players in a 5-6 player game, or 3 players in a 7-8 player game.
Protestant Victory
If: At any point starting after the Religious War Phase of Round 4:
There are more Protestant provinces than Catholic ones;
All Electors are Protestant; and
The Emperor is Protestant
Then: The Protestant players Once Saved and Always Saved are saved by Faith Alone and win; 2 players in a 5-6 player game, or 3 players in a 7-8 player game.
Peace of Westphalia Victory
If: After Round 6, there was neither a Catholic nor a Protestant Victory
Then: Subtract all Imperial Power contributed by Foreign Power Home Provinces. Then each player adds 3 Imperial Power for each orthodox town they own. The player with the most Imperial Power wins. In cases of ties, the winner is chosen from among the tied players by the Emperor. 

Variants

9-14 Player Expansion:
3 players win a Protestant/Catholic Victory in a 9 player game, 4 players win a Protestant/Catholic Victory in a 10-12 player game, and 5 players win a Protestant/Catholic Victory in a 13-14 player game.
Experimental Variants – Feel Free to:
Play with 3-4 players (1 player wins a Protestant/Catholic Victory in a 3 player game, 2 players win a Protestant/Catholic Victory in a 4 player game)
Adjust the number of players who can win a Religious Victory. The rules choose the lowest number possible that is at least 33% of players but less than 50%. Suggested variants include 2 players in a 7 player game, 4 for 9 players, 3 for 10 players, 3 or 5 for 11 players, 5 for 12 players, and 4 or 6 for 13-14 players (more than 25%, but still less than 50%).
Play with a bigger map than recommended for player size, make the map a different shape, adjust number of starting provinces, disregard rules regarding principality shape…
Or whatever other change you'd like!

From this point on:
Principality(ies) always refers to non-Player principalities unless stated.
Player(s) will always be used when referring to Players.
Orthodox means the same religion as the Player.

Setup in 10 Steps:

1. LAYOUT THE MAP – Layout the map where all can see. The hex tiles that will be played with will be clearly marked, depending on how many Players are playing, with 9 tiles per Player.

2. ARRANGE THE PIECES – Place the Catholic and Protestant Dice, as well as the Ottoman Dice, Principality Control Markers, Foreign Power Provinces, Protestant Provinces, military cards, and Principality towns within easy reach, Gold, Principality Cards, the Saved by Faith and Works and Once Saved Always Saved Cards.

3. PICK PLAYER COLOR AND FLAG – Each Player picks the hex set of their choice, with the flags of their chosen color.

4. PICK PROVINCES – Each Player submits a cube of their color. Randomly draw cubes for Setup Order. The First Player picks 4 provinces and places his control marker on them; three of these provinces must touch each other at a vertex and the entire principality must be contiguous. He then places a town on his chosen capital province. Other Players follow, in Setup Order.

5. PLACE ELECTORS – The First Player places an Elector of his choice anywhere on the map, and placing a town on the Elector's capital province. The Elector's provinces must be contiguous, unless impossible, but may be shaped however the Player desires. Other Players follow, in Setup Order, going back to the First Player at the end. The following starting Electors must be placed:

Trier, Mainz, and Cologne – 1 province
The Palatinate and Saxony – 2 provinces
Brandenburg – 3 provinces
Bohemia – 4 provinces

6. PLACE OTHER PRINCIPALITIES – After all starting Electors are placed, continuing in clockwise order, each Player places a 2 or 3 Province Principality of their choice, placing a town on the Principality's capital province. The Principality's provinces must be contiguous, but may be shaped however the Player desires		. When only disconnected single provinces remain, fill in the remaining provinces with 1 province Principalities.

7. RECEIVE AND PLACE DIPLOMATIC INFLUENCE – Each Player receives 3 Diplomatic Influence. The First Player places all of his Diplomatic Influence onto one or more Principalities of his choice. Other Players follow, in Setup Order. Players may not save their Diplomatic Influence during Setup. Players take the Control Marker for all their Principality allies they acquired, and place these markers in their respective slots on their Players boards.

8. ELECT THE EMPEROR – Elect the Emperor according to the Imperial Election rules. The Emperor receives additional Imperial Power according to the Round #/Year on the Emperor Card, (2, 2, 3, 3, 4, 4).

9. CHOOSE A MILITARY DOCTRINE – Choose a Military Doctrine and place your cube there. Players do this simultaneously, unless someone requests it be done in in Setup Order. The 7 available Military Doctrines are:
Flexible – an emphasis on flexibility
Defensive – an emphasis on pikemen
Offensive – an emphasis on musketeers and cavalry
Aristocratic – an emphasis on cavalry
Infantry – an emphasis on pikemen and musketeers
Traditional – an emphasis on pikemen and cavalry
Innovative – an emphasis on musketeers

10. SET UP PLAYER CARDS – Each Player places a cube on 4 Imperial Power. Each Player receives a Johann Tetzel Religion card. Each Player receives a Monastery token. Each Player places a cube at 0 Good Works. Players also receive a Council of Trent Token and French Interference Token. Each Player receives a Combat Heresy, Engage in Diplomacy, and Wage War card. Now let the games begin – proceed to Round 1.


How to Play

The game spans the years 1510-1660 and lasts 6 rounds, with each Round lasting ~25 years. Each Round the following phases take place:
 
Religious Upheaval
Player Turns:
Combat Heresy
Engage in Diplomacy
Wage War
Religious War
Diplomatic Shifts
Foreign Powers
Imperial Election

1. Religious Upheaval

Establish the Initiative Order for the Round, with the Emperor first, followed by Players ordered from weakest to strongest according to their Imperial Power, with ties resolved clockwise from the Emperor. Place control markers marking this Initiative Order.

Religious Upheaval
All provinces start Catholic. Whenever a province converts between Catholicism and Protestantism, add or remove a Protestant province on the underlying Catholic province.

Rounds 1-3:
Place 1 control marker for each Catholic Principality inside the Religious Upheaval Bag. Draw 2 control markers in a 5-6 Player game, 3 in a 7-8 Player game. All provinces from drawn Principalities convert to Protestantism. In addition, all Player non-capital provinces adjacent to the capitals of the converted Principalities convert to Protestantism.
Rounds 4-6: Put a control marker from every Principality into the Religious Upheaval Bag. Draw 2 Principality cards in a 5-6 Player game, 3 in a 7-8 Player game. If a drawn Principality is 1 province, it converts. If 2+ provinces, roll a Religion Die; it converts on a Cross/Crucifix.

After performing Religious Upheaval, place the drawn control markers near the Religious War section to indicate their eligibility to be a Target Principality.




2. Player Turns

Players earn 2 Gold for each town they own on orthodox (the religion they adhere to) provinces. Players do not earn Gold for allied towns or towns on heretical provinces. The trading and/or gifting of resources (Gold, Faith, Diplomatic Influence) is prohibited. 

During Player Turns, Players will choose 2/3 of Combat Heresy, Engage in Diplomacy, & Wage War, incurring Tradeoffs for the action they did not engage in.

Combat Heresy

At the beginning of Combat Heresy, all Players secretly either place a cube of their color in their hand or don't. Players that reveal a cube place their cube in Combat Heresy and engage in the following actions in order. Players that did not reveal a cube place two of their cubes in Engage in Diplomacy and Wage War.

Player Conversion
Call The Council of Trent
Spread the Faith

1. Player Conversion

All Players begin the game Catholic. All Non-Foreign Power Players Combatting Heresy have an opportunity to convert; they put their fists in the middle, and on a countdown of 3, 2, 1, show, Players show their thumbs up if they wish to convert. Players convert in Initiative Order, and upon conversion:
Lose all Faith and any Saints/Good Works.
Change the religion of your capital to your new religion. The is the only way your capital ever converts.
Ransack the Monasteries – When you convert to Protestantism for the first time, gain 2 Gold.
Blood of the Martyrs – If you return to Catholicism you gain however many Good Works the Player with the least has who is still saved, -2. May not go negative. If no Catholics remain, the first Player to return to Catholicism gains 6 Good Works (1 Saint Card and 1 Good Work on the chart).
Once Saved Always Saved – The first Players to convert to Protestantism are saved by Faith Alone, and cannot lose their salvation (unless they return to Catholicism, in which case they were never really saved by Faith Alone to begin with). Give such Players a Reformer Card of their choice to mark their salvation.

2. Call The Council of Trent

Until The Catholic Reformation begins, Catholic Players decide whether or not to call The Council of Trent and attempt to begin The Catholic Reformation:

First, all Catholic players, whether or not they chose to Combat Heresy, secretly place a Council of Trent token or a French Interference token in their hands. Players reveal simultaneously. All Players who submitted a Council of Trent token store up treasure in heaven and gain 1 Good Work. All Players who submitted a French Interference token gain 1 Diplomatic Influence as their worldly reward. If a majority are French Interference tokens, or the Emperor submits a French Interference token, the French interfere and the Council is delayed.
If at least half are Council of Trent tokens, including the Emperor's if he participates in the Council, then the Council meets but does not necessarily conclude. Roll the Ottoman Empire die; if it lands on an Ottoman Crescent (1-2), the Ottoman Empire threatens to disrupt the council, which disperses without concluding – better luck next round!
If the Ottoman Empire does not disrupt the Council, then The Council of Trent concludes and The Catholic Reformation begins; Church Abuses end, and the Sale of Indulgences is prohibited. The Catholic Players with the most Good Works, 2 in a 5-6 Player game and 3 in a 7-8 Player game are Saved by Faith and Works – exchange their Tetzel Cards for a Saved by Faith and Works Role Card. In the case of ties, the Players first in Initiative Order are Saved.
Saint Pius V & Victory at Lepanto – If the Council has not concluded by the end of Round 3, St. Pius V holds the Council outside the Empire, defeats the Ottoman Empire at Lepanto, and The Catholic Reformation begins anyway.

3. Spread the Faith

All Players Combatting Heresy now Earn Faith dice of their Respective Faith (and Gold if Catholic before the Catholic Reformation) based on the Round # and their total Saints.

Catholics:
The Catholic Reformation: Gain 2 Faith during The Catholic Reformation.
The Intercession of the Saints: +1 Faith per Saint.
Sale of Indulgences: Gain 1 Gold before The Catholic Reformation
The Prayer of the Monks: Gain 1 Good Work if you still have your Monastery

Protestants:
Down with The Whore of Babylon: 3 Faith Rounds 1-3
The Jesuits Strike Back: 1 Faith Rounds 4-6


Catholics and Protestants:
Zeal: +3 Faith for those saved by Faith and Works or Faith Alone. These are the Catholics who merit salvation by having the most Good Works after the Council of Trent, or the Protestants Once Saved Always Saved – 2 in a 5-6 Player game, 3 in a 7-8 Player game.
Imperial Sanction: +1 Faith for adherents of the Emperor's Religion
Church Patronage – Gold may be turned into Faith at a rate of 1 Gold:2 Faith

After Players have earned their Faith/Gold and decided whether to use Church Patronage (Initiative Order if requested), Players Spread the Faith. Roll all of your Faith dice. Each Cross or Crucifix rolled is a success. Catholics gain 1 Good Work for each Crucifix, and move their cube towards 5; upon reaching 5 Good Works, Catholics receive a Saint.
Church Abuses: Before the Council of Trent concludes, Catholics do not Spread the Faith. Instead of rolling their Faith dice, they convert their Faith into Good Works a rate of 2 Faith:1 Good Work. Extra Faith is lost.

Players then, in Initiative Order, place all of their successful dice on provinces of their choice, defensively or offensively:
Within their own territory on a non-capital province
In a neighboring (adjacent) Player-controlled non-capital province
On a neighboring or allied Principality (but not a neighbor of an ally)

Whenever a Player places a dice on a province with a dice of the opposing Faith, both dice are removed. Once all Players have placed their dice, provinces/Principalities convert:
Within their own territory – Dice of your religion placed on heretical provinces you control convert the province they're on, and an additional heretical province of your choice that you control that does not have a heretical dice on it.
In a neighboring Player-controlled province – Dice placed on heretical provinces of opposing Players convert the province they were placed on.
On a neighboring or allied Principality – Dice placed on Principalities convert the entire Principality if as many are on it as the Principality has provinces.

Engage in Diplomacy

At the beginning of Engage in Diplomacy, all Players that Combatted Heresy secretly either place a cube of their color in their hand or don't. Players that reveal a cube place their cube in Engage in Diplomacy and engage in the following actions in order. Players that did not reveal a cube place their remaining cube in Wage War.

Play the Diplomacy Game
Diplomatic Actions

1. Play the Diplomacy Game

First, in Initiative Order, all Players Engaging in Diplomacy play the Diplomacy Game with the Player after you in Initiative Order (or the first Player if you are last). Counting down from 3, 2, 1, until “Go,” both Players simultaneously either form a thumbs up or a finger gun.
If both Players formed a thumbs up, the Player whose Initiative it is gets 2 Diplomatic Influence, while the other Player gets 1 Diplomatic Influence.
If one Player formed a thumbs up, while the other formed a finger gun, the Player with the finger gun gets 3 Diplomatic Influence, while the other Player gets 0.
If both Players formed a finger gun, both Players get 0 Diplomatic Influence.

Unplaced Diplomatic Influence is stored on your capital. You may not move Diplomatic Influence between Principalities once placed. You may remove all (never only some) of your Diplomatic Influence at any time to prevent yourself from joining an allied Principality in war, or for any reason whatsoever. This influence goes back to the supply.

2. Diplomatic Actions

After all Players Engaging in Diplomacy have played the Diplomacy Game, in Initiative Order Players may do as many of the following as they like:

Place Diplomatic Influence:
You may place Diplomatic Influence on any Principalities of your choice.
To ally a Principality, you must have at least as much Diplomatic Influence as the Principality has provinces, and more Diplomatic Influence than any other Player.
You may ally a Principality regardless of the religion it follows.
When you ally a Principality, take its Control Marker and add it to your Player Card on the appropriate slot – 1-2 provinces grants 2 Imperial Power, 3-4 grants 3 Imperial Power, 5 grants 4 Imperial Power.

Provide Assistance
Players may pay Gold (to the bank) for Diplomatic Influence at a rate of 1:1

Join a League
Players saved by Faith and Works may join the Catholic League. They lose 1 Diplomatic Influence from each Protestant Principality they have influence with.
Players saved by Faith Alone may join the Evangelical League. They lose 1 Diplomatic Influence from each Catholic Principality they have influence with.
Players not saved by Faith Alone or by Faith and Works may join either League and lose no Diplomatic Influence upon Joining a League.
Players cannot change or leave Leagues.

Release Vassal
If you have a Province with a town on it, you may release a Principality as your “vassal”; replace your control marker with a Principality one. Place 2 influence on this Principality; you start its ally. Other Players may influence this Principality, and you may not retake this Principality except through war.

Gift Province
You may gift non-town provinces to Principalities if the provinces are adjacent to the Principality and the same religion as the Principality. Gain 1 Diplomatic Influence per gifted province with that Principality.

Wage War

Declare Wars & Change Military Doctrines
Battles & Peace Treaties

1. Declare Wars & Change Military Doctrines

In Initiative Order, each Player Waging War may do any or all of the following 3 things:

1. Declare War on either an eligible Player or an unaligned Principality.
If you do not want to Declare War, you may pass.
Before Declaring War on an unaligned Principality you must first remove all of your Diplomatic Influence from that Principality.
You may not Declare War on a Player or an unaligned Principality who has already been Declared War on
Foreign Powers may not Declare War or be Declared War upon unless they have at least one province or ally in the Empire.

When a war is declared, place both Players, or the Player and the unaligned Principality in the First Battle Phase, in the order the war was declared. If either the Player or the Principality is already in the First Battle Phase, place them in the Second Battle Phase, in the order the war was declared. Likewise for the Third Battle Phase.

2. Join a League and/or Declare a Religious War:
Players may Join a League, as in Engaging in Diplomacy
If a Religious War has not yet been Declared, a Player in a League saved by Faith Alone or Faith and Works (including Foreign Powers, even if they have no provinces or allies in the Empire) may Declare a Religious War against a heretical Target Principality.
Only the following are eligible as Target Principalities:
Those drawn during Religious Upheaval
A Principality you have enough Diplomatic Influence to ally, and:
Are its ally, or;
Are within 2 Diplomatic Influence of being its ally (no ties).
When a Religious War is Declared, the Declarer becomes the Restorer of The Faith (ROTF). Place his control marker in the corresponding slot. Do not remove any of his influence from the Target Principality.

3. Change Military Doctrine
Players may change their Military Doctrine by moving their cube.

When all Players Waging War have had an opportunity to Declare Wars and change their Military Doctrines, proceed to Battles & Peace Treaties. The Religious War, if any, will be waged in the next phase.

2. Battles & Peace Treaties

Complete all battles in the First Battle Phase, then sign Peace Treaties in the order Players were placed in a Battle Phase. Then complete all battles in the Second Battle Phase followed by Peace Treaties. Likewise for a Third Battle Phase. If a Player or Principality is eliminated before a battle, that battle does not occur.

1. Battles.
When battling an unaligned Principality, the first Player after you in Initiative Order not participating in a battle at the moment leads them in battle. No collusion to battle poorly is allowed. Players pair off separately into their respective battles and fight simultaneously during the Battle Phase.

If a Player's Army Size + Reserves is twice as large as an opponent's, he wins the battle automatically without drawing Military Cards.

If not, Players randomly draw cards from the deck according to their Imperial Power – up to a max of 12 cards, with the rest of their Imperial Power going towards Reserves. After drawing Military Cards, Players may pay Gold to draw extra Military Cards of their choice at a rate of 1:1. In addition, Players may discard up to 2 cards faceup and draw replacements according to their Military Doctrines. Do these simultaneously unless a Player requests it be done in Initiative Order.

Military Doctrines:
Flexible – May discard any unit for any other unit
Defensive – May discard 1 musketeer or cavalry for 2 pikemen
Offensive – May discard 1 pikeman for 1 musketeer and 1 cavalry
Aristocratic – May discard 1 pikeman or musketeer for 2 cavalry
Infantry – May discard 1 cavalry for 1 pikeman and 1 musketeer
Traditional – May discard 1 musketeer for 1 pikeman and 1 cavalry
Innovative – May discard 1 pikeman or cavalry for 2 musketeers

During battle Players play cards face-down, then flip them face-up. If the cards are the same, both are discarded. If the cards pit:

Pikemen vs. Cavalry – Discard the Cavalry and return the Pikeman to its owner's hand. The player who played Cavalry may not play Cavalry again next round. If he only has Cavalry, he routes.

Musketeers vs. Pikemen – Discard the Pike and return the Musket to its owner's hand.
Advanced Rifling – Rounds 5-6 in addition, the Player who played the Pikeman must discard an additional card of his opponent's choice. If he does not have any more of that type of unit, he must say so. The Player who played Musketeers then chooses another unit type for his opponent to discard instead.

Cavalry vs. Musketeers – Discard the Musket and return the Cavalry to its owner's hand. The Player who played Musketeers discards an additional Pikeman and Musketeer from his hand. If he lacks one of the unit types he must say so and discard 2 of the infantry he does have instead. If he does not have 2 infantry cards to discard, he routes. In addition, if the Player who played Cavalry has 2x his opponent's cards, his opponent routes.

Call for Reinforcements – After any round of battle a Player may Call for Reinforcements. He also may be forced to Call for Reinforcements by a route, or running out of cards. When Calling for Reinforcements, he draws from his battle discard pile as many Military Cards as his Imperial Power says he has reinforcements. The cards he draws are of his choice, but he may not draw more than he has cards in the discard pile, even if his Imperial Power says he gets more reinforcements. A Player may only Call for Reinforcements once during a battle.

If a Player runs out of cards or routes, he discards the rest of his cards and must call for his reinforcements. If he does not have reinforcements or has already called for reinforcements, he loses the battle. If both Players run out of cards and reinforcements, the battle is Inconclusive and the Players sign a White Peace; neither Player conquers provinces from the other or loses influence with allies.

2. Peace Treaties
If you win:
Conquer 1 province with a town, or up to 2 provinces without one from the unaligned Principality or the Player and his allies.
For every town you take you lose 2 Diplomatic Influence.
For every province you take without a town that wasn't adjacent at the start of your turn you lose 1 Diplomatic Influence, unless you're the Emperor taking from a Foreign Power.
Additionally, your allies may each take 1 adjacent province from the unaligned Principality or the Player and his allies. Lose 2 Diplomatic Influence from each of your allies that could have conquered a province but did not (the ability to take a province is determined at the start of the war). Principalities cannot grow past 5 provinces.
If you lose to a Player, they may do to you what you would have been able to do to them. If you lose to an unaligned Principality, it conquers two (one if only one available) non-town provinces of your choice from you and/or your allies. The provinces need not be adjacent to the unaligned Principality. If there are no eligible provinces for you to lose, then you are eliminated and become a Foreign Power if not already.
You lose 2 Diplomatic Influence with each of your allies per province they lost.

Additionally:
Only Players may conquer towns; remove all Diplomatic Influence from conquered Principalities. Capitals may only be taken if they are that Power's last province.
You may choose to immediately vassalize a Principality (or former Player-owned capital) instead of taking it. Keep the Principality's control marker on province (or replace the Player's with a new Principality control marker). You lose no Diplomatic Influence for vassalizing; instead, remove all Diplomatic Influence from other Players from the Principality and place 2 Diplomatic Influence on the Principality; you are now its ally.
Electors may not be conquered and must be vassalized instead.
You lose all Diplomatic Influence from Principalities that you had Diplomatic Influence with when you personally (not an ally) take a province from them.
If a Principality conquers a province of a different religion, that province is forcibly converted to the Principality's religion (No Saints earned).

3. Religious War

1. Religious War Declared

If no Religious War was Triggered, or if the Target Principality no longer exists, proceed to Diplomatic Shifts.

If a Religious War was Triggered and the Target Principality still exists:
First, go through all Players with Diplomatic Influence on the Target Principality who aren't currently in a League from the Player with the most DI to the least. Players with DI on the Target Principality must Join a League (either one) or lose all DI with the Target Principality.
Second, if the Emperor is not yet a member of a League, he may Join a League.
Finally, the Player with the most DI on the Target Principality in the DOTF's League becomes the DOTF. If no Players in the DOTF's League have DI with the Target Principality, the Player first in Initiative Order becomes the DOTF. The DOTF gains DI with the Target Principality sufficient to become its ally if not already.

If there is no DOTF, the ROTF's League wins; proceed to the Religious War Peace Treaty phase. If there is a DOTF, all members in the Catholic League go to war with all members in the Evangelical League.

2. Religious War Battle

First, as during Wage War, each Player participating in the Religious War draws Military Cards according to his Imperial Power, and may discard and draw additional cards according to his Military Doctrine and Gold spent.
Then the Leagues fight, following the standard rules for battle except:
Players fight separately with as many Players as possible fighting at once.
Players line up in Initiative Order by League and pair off, with those without opponents “In Reserve.”
Players only route when they run out of infantry in the face of a cavalry charge or only have cavalry when stopped by pikemen; they do not route if they have ½ as many Military Cards as their opponent after a cavalry charge, unless you are the last Player remaining in your League and the opposing League combined has 2x the Military Cards as you after you lose a cavalry charge.
When a Player routes, he exits the melee. The victorious Player's army does not return to full strength after winning the engagement, but instead either immediately begins to battle the Player first up “In Reserve” in the opposing League or, if there are no Players “In Reserve” in the opposing League, gets in line “In Reserve.”

3. Religious War Peace Treaty

After the battle, if the ROTF's League:
Won, then the Target Principality is forcibly converted. All Players in the DOTF's League immediately lose all Diplomatic Influence with the Target Principality. The ROTF then gains 2 Diplomatic Influence with the Target Principality. The Target Principality may neither take provinces nor have its provinces taken in the Peace Treaty. Its ally, if any, therefore will not lose any influence with the Target Principality.
Lost, then the Target Principality retains its religion. All Players in the ROTF's League immediately lose all Diplomatic Influence with the Target Principality. The DOTF then gains 2 Diplomatic Influence with the Target Principality. The Target Principality may take provinces in the Peace Treaty as normal.
Next, if the Emperor was in the League of his religion and he:
Won, then he may remove any number of heretical Electors who fought in the Defeated League from the Electorate, replacing them with Electors of his choice of his own religion.
Lost, then the Player(s) of the opposing League with the most Imperial Power may remove any number of Electors of the Emperor's religion who fought in the Defeated League from the Electorate, replacing them with Electors of his (their) choice of the opposing Religion. Initiative Order in the case of ties.
Finally, members of the Victorious League, in Initiative Order, may conquer provinces from the Defeated League. Players do not lose Diplomatic Influence for taking towns and non-adjacent provinces. Otherwise, the rules for Peace Treaties in Religious Wars are exactly the same as those during Player Turns
The Leagues reset – No one starts in either League heading into the next round.

4. Diplomatic Shifts

All remaining Gold turns into Diplomatic Influence at a rate of 1:1 and is placed on Player capitals. All Players with DI on their capitals then lose 1 DI.
If you are the Emperor:
Gain 1 Diplomatic Influence, which you may place or save, if Foreign Powers (other than yourself) own zero provinces in the Empire, or you and your allies conquered at least one province from a Foreign Power this Round.
Lose 4 Diplomatic Influence (saved or placed) if Foreign Powers (other than yourself) own provinces in the Empire and you did not fight in a war (Private or Religious) against a Foreign Power.
If you are not the Emperor:
You lose 2 DI (saved or placed) if you did not fight in a war (Private or Religious).

Do simultaneously, unless a Player requests it be done in Initiative Order.




5. Foreign Powers

You may become a Foreign Power if you have no towns and 5 or less provinces.

If you lose all of your provinces during the Round you immediately become a Foreign Power. Remove the influence you lost due to the war, including any eliminated allies. Then complete steps 2-5 of Becoming a Foreign Power, but wait until the next Round before doing anything else.

Lose all provinces you possessed inside the Empire. You gain 1 DI for each non-capital province you had. If you had any provinces inside the Empire, these form one new Principality; swap all of your control markers on the board for control markers of the new Principality. Swap your city for a Principality town.
Lose any Gold you had – you should've used it to not die.
Count the Diplomatic Influence you have saved and on Principalities. Remove it all and give yourself back ½, rounding down.
Your Foreign Power is same Religion you were in the Empire, and you may not convert. Keep your Saints and your Religion Card. Faith dice may not be placed on your Home Province to convert it.
Choose a Foreign Power Home Province and place it next to one of the 6 edges of the map of your choice. You are not limited by the placement of other Foreign Power Home Provinces. Your Foreign Power Home Province is now adjacent to all provinces on that edge of the map for purposes of conversion and Peace Treaties. Your Foreign Power Home Province cannot be conquered. This province starts with a city and is your capital. It grants you 2, 4, 6, 9, or 12 Imperial Power, depending on the Year, +/- a Foreign Affairs die roll -2, -1, 0, 0, 1, 2 every Round. Your provinces inside the HRE still provide Imperial Power.

6. Imperial Election

The Emperor – If you have been Emperor for one round only, roll the Imperial Die. If you roll the Imperial Eagle, you survive. If you roll a skull (3/6) you die. You die automatically if you have been Emperor for two rounds, or left the Empire to become a Foreign Power. If you die as the Emperor, the Electors hold an Imperial Election.

The Emperor is elected by the 7 Electors of the Holy Roman Empire. These start as the 7 historical Electors of this time period – Trier, Mainz, Cologne, Saxony, The Palatinate, Brandenburg, and Bohemia. Throughout the game different Principalities may become Electors, but a Player may never become an Elector.
Players allied to Electors control their votes.
Only a Player may receive votes for Emperor.
Players may vote for whomever they wish, including themselves and Players of a different religion from themselves or the Electors whose votes they control. Any Player may become Emperor, including Foreign Powers.
A Player may not refuse election.
Players attempt to secure the votes of a majority of the Electors (4) to be elected Emperor. Unaligned Electors vote as a block for the Player of their religion with the most votes after all Players have voted. Initiative/Setup Order between tied Players. If a majority cannot be secured, the Emperor may be elected by a plurality.
Give the newly elected Emperor the Emperor Card, and place the Imperial Die on the Round #/Year.
