The Historical Scene

The year is 1510. You are a Prince (or Princess) in the Holy Roman Empire.

And it's about to go down.

The Catholic Church is mired in corruption and scandal, and judgment has come for Her sins in the form of a young friar by the name of Martin Luther. Choose sides in the ensuing religious struggle:

Will you stick with the Catholic Church, attempt to reform the Church from within, and struggle from behind to win back the souls of the German people?
Or will you join the Protestant Revolutionaries and strive to rid the Whore of Babylon's influence from the land?
Will you seek ye first the kingdom, or subordinate faith to power politics?

Lead your principality through this turbulent time period. As Europe's religious firestorm culminates in the cataclysmic 30 Years War, will the One True Faith triumph? Or will religious divisions become entrenched in the Peace of Westphalia?

How to Win

Victory can be achieved in one of three ways:

Catholic Victory
If: After the Imperial Election Rounds 4 and 5:
33, 37, 49, or 52 provinces in a 5, 6, 7, or 8 Player game are Catholic;
6 Electors in a 6/8 Player Game, or all 7 in a 5/7 Player game are Catholic; &
The Emperor is Catholic
Then: The Catholic players Saved by Faith and Works win; up to 2 players in a 5-6 player game and 3 players in a 7-8 player game.
Protestant Victory
If: After the Imperial Election Rounds 4 and 5:
33, 37, 49, or 52 provinces in a 5, 6, 7, or 8 Player game are Protestant;
6 Electors in a 6/8 Player Game, or all 7 in a 5/7 Player game are Protestant; &
The Emperor is Protestant
Then: The Protestant players Saved by Faith Alone win; up to 2 players in a 5-6 player game and 3 players in a 7-8 player game.
Peace of Westphalia Victory
If: After Round 5, there was neither a Catholic nor a Protestant Victory
Then: The player with the most Imperial Power wins. Foreign Powers do not count the Imperial Power contributed by their Foreign Power Home Province. For every orthodox town-province you have, add 2 Imperial Power to your total. In the case of a tie, the Emperor chooses the winner from among the tied players. 

Definitions & General Rules

From this point on:
Principality(ies) always refers to non-Player principalities unless stated.
Player(s) will always be used when referring to Players.
Orthodox means the same religion as the Player.
There is no trading and/or gifting of resources (Gold, Faith, Diplomatic Influence).
Setup in 7 Steps:

1. LAYOUT THE MAP AND GAME PIECES – Lay the map where all can see. The hex tiles that will be played with will be clearly marked, depending on how many Players are playing, with 12 tiles per Player. Place the Catholic and Protestant HRE Elector Markers, the Military Cards, pennies, Faith Dice, and Religion Role Cards in an easily accessible space.

2. PLAYERS PICK COLOR AND FLAG AND SET UP – Pick a hex set with the desired color and flag combination of your choice and take the corresponding Player Board, Reference Card Set, and colored cubes. Each set should also contain a Council of Trent Token, a French Interference Token, Reserves Token, and Monastery Token. Organize these all near your Player Board. Place a cube on 3 Imperial Power on your Player Board, and then take a Catholic in a State of Mortal Sin Religious Role Card.

3. PICK PROVINCES – Each Player submits a cube of his color. Randomly draw cubes for Setup Order. The First Player places his capital hex and 2 non-town hexes adjacent to each other, either in a clover shape or a C-shape. All Players do likewise, in Setup Order.

4. PLACE ELECTORS – Next, the First Player places an Elector of his choice anywhere on the map. The Elector's provinces must be contiguous, unless impossible, but may be shaped however the Player desires. Each Elector must have a capital province with a town. Other Players follow, in Setup Order, going back to the First Player at the end. The following starting Electors must be placed:

Trier, Mainz, and Cologne – 1 province
The Palatinate and Saxony – 2 provinces
Brandenburg – 3 provinces
Bohemia – 4 provinces

5. PLACE OTHER PRINCIPALITIES – After all starting Electors are placed, continuing in Setup Order, each Player places a 3 Province Principality of his choice, with provinces contiguous and either clover shaped or C-shaped. Each Principality must have a capital province with a town. When no more 3 Province Principalities of the proper shape can be placed, continue placing 2 Province Principalities. When only disconnected single provinces remain, fill in the remaining provinces with 1 province Principalities. When all Principalities are placed, put the unused Principality hexes back in the box. They will only be needed if Players are eliminated and become Foreign Powers. Look through the Principality cards and take out the Principalities in play, putting the unused Principality cards back in the box. Shuffle the Principality cards in play.

6. RECEIVE AND PLACE DIPLOMATIC INFLUENCE – Each Player receives 4 Diplomatic Influence. The First Player in Setup Order places all his Diplomatic Influence onto one or more Principalities of his choice. Other Players follow, in Setup Order. Players may not save their Diplomatic Influence. Players take the Control Markers for all their Principality allies they acquired, and place these markers in their respective slots on their Players boards.

7. ELECT THE EMPEROR – Elect the Emperor according to the Imperial Election rules. Place a cube of his on Round 1 – 1510 on the Player Board. The Emperor receives 2 Diplomatic Influence, which he stores on his capital at this time. Give the Emperor the Ottoman Die as well. Then… let the games begin! Proceed to Round 1 – 1510.


How to Play

The game spans the years 1510-1660 and lasts 5 rounds, with each Round lasting 30 years. Each Round the following phases take place:
 
Religious Upheaval
Combat Heresy
Engage in Diplomacy
Wage War
Religious Warfare
Foreign Powers
Imperial Election

1. Religious Upheaval

All provinces start Catholic. Whenever a province converts between Catholicism and Protestantism, flip the province over.

Rounds 1-2:
Draw X cards from the Principality deck, where X = # of Players, redrawing for any Principalities already Protestant. All provinces from drawn Principalities convert to Protestantism. In addition, all Player non-capital provinces adjacent to the capitals of the converted Principalities convert to Protestantism.
Rounds 3-5: Draw cards from the Principality deck, 2 in a 5-6 Player game, 3 in a 7-8 Player game. The drawn Principalities convert.

Next, arrange the Initiative Order for the Round so that the Emperor is first, followed by Players ordered from weakest to strongest according to their Imperial Power, with ties resolved clockwise from the Emperor.


2. Combat Heresy

Player Conversion
Call The Council of Trent
Spread the Faith

1. Player Conversion

All Players begin the game Catholic, and may convert between Catholicism and Protestantism at the beginning of Combat Heresy unless they're a Foreign Power. All Players put their fists in the middle, and on a countdown of 3, 2, 1, show, Players show their thumbs up if they wish to convert, thumbs down if not. If multiple Players convert, resolve in Initiative Order. Upon conversion:
Cuius Regio, Eius Religio – Change the religion of your capital to your new religion. The is the only way your capital ever converts.
The Freedom of a Christian – Upon converting to Protestantism, lose all Good Works and/or Saints.
Ransack the Monasteries – When you convert to Protestantism for the first time, turn in your Monastery token and gain 3 Gold.
All Players start out “not saved” with the Catholic State of Mortal Sin Religion Role Card. The Protestant version of this Religion Role Cad is the Predestined to Hell Role Card. Players can “become saved” by converting to Protestantism or gaining Good Works. Players must take a saved Religion Role Card if they meet the requirements.
The first 2 Players (3 in a 7-8 Player game) to respond to God's irresistible grace and convert to Protestantism take a Saved by Faith Alone Role Card. Once Saved Always Saved – there is nothing you can do to lose this Role Card… except return to Catholicism. If you do so, give your Role Card to the Protestant Predestined to Hell first in Initiative Order. If there are no other Protestants, the next Player to convert to Protestantism gains this role card.
Blood of the Martyrs – If you return to Catholicism you gain however many Good Works the Player with the least has who is still saved, -2. May not go negative.
St. Francis de Sales – If no Catholics remain, the first Player to return to Catholicism gains X Saint tokens, where X is the Round #.
The 2 (3 in a 7-8 Player game) Catholic Players with the most Good Works, and at least 1 Good Work, merit salvation and take a Saved by Faith and Works Role Card. In the case of ties, the Catholic Player(s) first in Initiative Order gain(s) this role card.

After conversion, give each Player 2 Gold for each orthodox capital or town-province they own. Players do not earn Gold for allied towns or heretical town-provinces.

2. Call The Council of Trent

Until The Catholic Reformation begins, Catholic Players decide whether or not to call The Council of Trent and attempt to begin The Catholic Reformation:

First, all Catholic players secretly place a Council of Trent or French Interference token in their hands. Reveal simultaneously; if you submitted a Council of Trent token you store up treasure in heaven and gain 1 Good Work – check Role Cards. If you submitted a French Interference token you gain 1 Diplomatic Influence stored on your capital as your worldly reward. If a majority are French Interference tokens, or the Emperor submits a French Interference token, the French interfere and the Council is delayed.
If at least half are Council of Trent tokens, including the Emperor's if he's Catholic, then the Council meets but does not necessarily conclude. Roll the Ottoman Empire die; if it lands on an Ottoman Crescent (1-2), the Ottoman Empire threatens to disrupt the council, which disperses without concluding – better luck next round!
If the Ottoman Empire does not disrupt the Council, then The Council of Trent concludes and The Catholic Reformation begins; Church Abuses end, the Sale of Indulgences is prohibited, and all Catholic Players gain 2 Saints.
Saint Pius V & Victory at Lepanto – If the Council has not concluded by the end of Round 2, St. Pius V holds the Council outside the Empire, defeats the Ottoman Empire at Lepanto, and The Catholic Reformation begins anyway.

3. Spread the Faith

Players now Earn Faith dice of their Respective Faith (and Gold if Catholic before the Catholic Reformation) based on the Round # and their total Saints.

Catholics:
Intercession of the Saints: 1 Faith per Saint.
Sale of Indulgences: Gain 1 Gold before The Catholic Reformation
Ora et Labora: Gain 2 Good Works if you still have your Monastery Token.

Protestants:
Down with The Whore of Babylon: 5 Faith Rounds 1-3
The Jesuits Strike Back: 3 Faith Rounds 4-5

Catholics and Protestants:
Zeal: +2 Faith for those saved by Faith and Works or Faith Alone.
Imperial Sanction: +2 Faith for adherents of the Emperor's Religion.
Church Patronage: Players may turn Gold into Faith at a rate of 1 Gold:2 Faith.

After Players have earned their Faith/Gold, Players decide whether to use Church Patronage secretly and simultaneously. Then Players Spread the Faith; roll all of your Faith dice. Each Cross/Crucifix rolled is a success for Protestants/Catholics respectively.

Salvation Race – Catholics gain 1 Good Work token for each Crucifix, which they mark on their Good Works Die, trading it in for 1 Saint every time they get 5 Good Works.

Players then, in Initiative Order, place all of their successful dice on provinces of their choice, defensively or offensively. Dice may be placed:
In any of your own provinces;
On any Principality or Player-province within a contiguous chain of provinces of your religion that flows from your capital;
On any Principality or Player-province one hex beyond this chain of contiguous provinces of your religion that flows from your capital.
Church Abuses: Before the Council of Trent concludes, Catholics may not place their Faith Dice in Protestant Provinces or Principalities.

Whenever a Player places a die on a Principality with a dice of the opposing Faith, both dice are removed; place a Religious Upheaval Token on the Principality's Capital to indicate its eligibility to be a Target Principality. Once all Players have placed their dice: provinces/Principalities convert:
A Principality converts if as many are on it as the Principality has provinces. If not enough dice were placed, the Principality does not convert.
Dice of your own religion on your provinces cancel up to 2 dice of the opposing religion placed on the same province. Remove all canceled dice. Dice of an opposing religion remaining then convert the province they are on, except Player capitals.
For each town of yours that converts to the opposing religion, lose 2 Gold. In addition, lose 2 Gold if you have any opposing dice remaining on your capital.

After province conversion, remove all dice and proceed to Engage in Diplomacy.
3. Engage in Diplomacy

The Diplomacy Game

In Initiative Order, Players play the Diplomacy Game with the Player directly after them in Initiative Order (or the first Player if you are last). Players face each other and count down “3, 2, 1, “Go!” Simultaneously, Players form either a thumbs up or a finger gun:
If both Players formed a thumbs up, both Player gain 2 Diplomatic Influence.
If one Player formed a thumbs up, while the other formed a finger gun, the Player with the finger gun gains 4 Influence and the other Player gain 0 Influence.
If both Players formed a finger gun, both Players gain 1 Influence.

This Influence is temporarily stored on your capital, along with any other temporarily stored Influence. All Diplomatic Influence must be spent during Engage in Diplomacy. You may not move Influence between Principalities once placed.

Place Diplomatic Influence
After playing the Diplomacy Game, Players place Diplomatic Influence in Initiative Order. Place Influence on any Principality(ies) of your choice, regardless of Religion or allies. To ally a Principality, you must have 1 Influence on the Principality per province it has, and more Influence than any other Player. When you ally a Principality, take its Control Marker and add it to your Player Card on the appropriate slot. Another Player may not displace you as the ally unless he surpasses you in Influence; you remain the ally in case of ties. In addition to placing Influence, Players may also:
Provide Assistance – Players may pay Gold (to the bank) for Influence at a rate of 1:1.
Release Vassal – If you have a town-Province, you may release it as your “vassal”; replace your province with a new Principality's capital. Place 2 influence on this Principality; you start its ally. (Other Players may influence this Principality).
Gift Province – You may gift same-religion, non-town provinces to adjacent 1-3 sized Principalities. Gain 1 Influence per gifted province with that Principality.

Wage War

Declare War

Each Player draws 3 Military Doctrine Cards. Then, in Initiative Order, each Player may Declare War on one or more unaligned Principalities, against another Player, or declare a Religious War.

Declare War Against One or More Unaligned Principalities
You must remove all of your Influence from the Principality(ies) and have at least twice the Imperial Power of all chosen Unaligned Principalities combined. You may pay 1 Gold for 1 Temporary IP in order to achieve this.
Immediately resolve the Peace Treaty before the next Player Declares War.
A Player may remove all of his Influence, which goes back to the supply, in order to avoid defending a now unaligned Principality.

Declare War Against a Player
The Player may not have already been Declared War on. Place cubes from both Players in the First Battle Phase in the order the war was declared. If either Player is already in the First Battle Phase, place them in the Second Battle Phase. Likewise for the Third Battle Phase.

Declare a Religious War – A potential team war resolved in Religious War Phase.
Players “Saved” may Declare a Religious War against any eligible heretical Target Principality:
Principalities with a Religious Upheaval Marker on them not already made a Target Principality are eligible Target Principalities. Lift the Religious Upheaval Marker upright.
The Declarer joins either the Catholic or the Evangelical League, according to his Religion, placing a corresponding Faith Dice on his capital to signify this.
Do not remove any Influence from the Target Principality as in a Regular War.

When all Players Waging War have had an opportunity to Declare War, proceed to Battles & Peace Treaties. The Religious War, if any, will be waged in the next phase. Remove all non-upright Religious Upheaval Markers.

2. Battles & Peace Treaties

Complete all battles in the First Battle Phase, then sign Peace Treaties in the order Players were placed in a Battle Phase. Then complete all battles in the Second Battle Phase followed by Peace Treaties. Likewise for a Third Battle Phase. If a Player is eliminated before a battle, that battle/war does not occur. 

1. Battle Phase.
Players then pair off into their respective battles and fight simultaneously during a Battle Phase. If you have 2x the Imperial Power of your opponent, you win automatically without drawing Military Cards. Otherwise, randomly draw Military Cards from a Colored Deck according to your Imperial Power, drawing 1 Military Card per IP up to a max of 12 cards. The rest of your IP goes to Reserves – Place your Reserve Token on your Player Card to indicate your Reserves.

After drawing Military Cards, in Initiative Order, Players choose one of their Military Doctrines to play and execute, and may pay Gold to draw extra Military Cards of their choice at a rate of 1:1 from the Black Deck, or another color either not in use or already drawn from.

Military Doctrines:
Flexible – You may discard 2 cards of your choice for any other 2 cards. 
Defensive –  You may discard 1 musketeer and 1 cavalry for 4 pikemen.
Offensive – You may discard 2 pikeman for 2 musketeers and 2 cavalry.
Aristocratic – You may discard 1 pikeman and 1 musketeer for 4 cavalry.
Tercio – You may discard 2 cavalry for 2 pikemen and 2 musketeers.
Traditional – You may discard 2 musketeers for 2 pikemen and 2 cavalry.
Innovative – You may discard 1 pikeman and 1 cavalry for 4 musketeers.
Guerilla – If you have 8 cards or less, you may discard 2 cards to look at opponent's hand. If you have 9+ cards you may discard 3 cards to do so. Then, if opponent has 8 cards or less, discard 1 card of your choice from opponent's hand. If opponent has 9+ cards, discard 2 cards of your choice from his hand.

Cards discarded due to Military Doctrines are returned to the deck. During battle Players play cards face-down, then flip them face-up. If the cards are the same, both are discarded in separate discard piles next to each respective Player. If the cards pit:

Pikemen vs. Cavalry – Discard the Cavalry and return the Pikeman to its owner's hand. The player who played Cavalry may not play Cavalry again next round. If he only has Cavalry, he routes.

Musketeers vs. Pikemen – Discard the Pike and return the Musket to its owner's hand.
Advanced Rifling – Rounds 4-5 in addition, the Player who played the Pikeman must discard an additional card of his opponent's choice. If he does not have any more of that type of unit, he must say so. The Player who played Musketeers then chooses another unit type for his opponent to discard instead.

Cavalry vs. Musketeers – Discard the Musket and return the Cavalry to its owner's hand. The Player who played Musketeers discards an additional 2 infantry (Pikemen or Musketeers) cards of his choice from his hand. If he does not have 2 infantry cards to discard, he routes. In addition, if the Player who played Cavalry has 2x his opponent's cards, his opponent routes.

Call for Reinforcements – You may Call for Reinforcement after any round of battle; draw from your respective discard pile up to as many Military Cards as your Reinforcement Marker indicates. You may choose which cards you draw, and must show your opponent, but may not draw more than you have in the discard pile, even if you have more potential reinforcements. You may only Call for Reinforcements once per battle.

If a Player runs out of cards, he routes, in addition to the above possible routes. If a Player routes, he loses the battle, even if he has not Called for Reinforcements. If both Players run out of cards at the same time, the battle is Inconclusive and the Players sign a White Peace; neither Player conquers provinces from the other or loses influence with allies.

2. Peace Treaty Phase
If you win, you may choose between the following 3 options:
Conquer 1 Town or up to 2 Provinces from the unaligned Principality(ies) or the Player and his allies. You are limited by the hexes included in the game.
If you conquer any territory that was not adjacent to you at the start of the Battle, you lose 1 DI from each Principality you have DI with.
If you conquer a town, lose 1 DI from each Principality you have DI with.
This Influence is lost after your allies have an opportunity to take provinces.
Vassalize a 1-2 Province Principality or Player. Keep the Principality's control marker on province (or replace the Player's with a new Principality control marker). You lose no Diplomatic Influence for vassalizing; instead, remove all Diplomatic Influence from other Players from the Principality and place 2 Diplomatic Influence on the Principality; you are now its ally.
Electors and the Target Principalities may not be completely conquered and must be vassalized instead.
Liberate a Principality – Take a Player-controlled town or capital, and replace it with a new Principality. You start as its ally with 2 DI.

In addition to one of the above, each of your allies may take 1 adjacent province from the unaligned Principality or the Player and his allies. Principalities cannot grow past 4 provinces and cannot conquer towns.

If you lose, in addition to whatever your opponent takes or vassalizes:
You lose 1 Diplomatic Influence on each of your allies per province they lost.
Additionally:
Remove all Diplomatic Influence from conquered Principalities.
Capitals may only be taken if they are that Power's last province.
You lose all Diplomatic Influence from Principalities that you had Diplomatic Influence with when you personally (not an ally) take a province from them.
If a Principality conquers a province of a different religion, that province is forcibly converted to the Principality's religion (no Saints earned).
If, as a result of a loss of DI, Players are tied for first in DI with a Principality, but neither is its ally, the Player first in Initiative Order immediately becomes its ally.
If you defeat a Foreign Power with no allies or Provinces in the Empire, congrats.

3. Post-War Diplomacy

At the end of Declare War, if you did not Declare a Religious War, lose one influence from each Principality that was an ally of yours throughout the entirety of Wage War that did not gain a province in a war with you, regardless of the reason, including if there were no eligible provinces or your ally was size 4.
If no Religious War was Declared, re-shuffle the Military Doctrine cards and proceed to Foreign Powers. If a Religious War was Declared, proceed to Religious War.
5. Religious War

1. The Catholic and Evangelical Leagues Form

First, the Declarers of Religious War lose 1 Diplomatic Influence from each Principality they have influence with of the opposing Religion.
Next, in Initiative Order, each Player may Join a League or Decline to Join. Players who Decline to Join lose all DI with the Target Principality(ies).
Players saved by Faith and Works may join the Catholic League only. If they do so, they lose 1 DI from each Protestant Principality they have influence with.
Players saved by Faith Alone may join the Evangelical League only. If they do so, they lose 1 DI from each Catholic Principality they have influence with.
Players not saved by Faith Alone or by Faith and Works may join either League and lose no Diplomatic Influence upon Joining a League.
Finally, the Player with the most Diplomatic Influence (Initiative Order in the case of ties) with each individual Target Principality in its League gains DI with that Target Principality sufficient to become its ally, if not allied already. If no Players in the Target Principality's League have DI with it, then the Player in the Target Principality's League first in Initiative Order becomes its ally.

If there are no Players in the League of the Target Principality(ies), the Declarer(s) of the Religious War win(s) automatically; proceed to the Religious War Peace Treaty phase. If there are Players on both sides, all members in the Catholic League go to war with all members in the Evangelical League; proceed to Religious War Battle phase.

2. Religious War Battle Phase

In a Religious War Battle, follow the standard rules for battle except:
When all Players have drawn their Military Cards and placed their Reserve Tokens, Players separate into their respective Leagues and line up in Initiative Order.
Players pair off and fight separately, with as many Players as possible fighting at once, and those without opponents waiting in line for an opponent “In Reserve.”
Players only route when they run out of infantry in the face of a cavalry charge or only have cavalry when stopped by pikemen; you do not route if you have ½ as many Military Cards as your opponent after a cavalry charge, unless you are the last Player remaining in your League and the opposing League combined has 2x the Military Cards as you after you lose a cavalry charge.
When a Player routes, he exits the melee. The victorious Player's army does not return to full strength after winning the engagement, but instead either immediately begins to battle the Player first up “In Reserve” in the opposing League or, if there are no Players “In Reserve” in the opposing League, gets in line “In Reserve.”





3. Religious War Peace Treaty

After the battle, Players in the Defeated League lose all Diplomatic Influence with all Target Principalities. If a Target Principality's League was defeated, it is forcibly converted and the Declarer gains sufficient Diplomatic Influence to become its new ally.
Next, if the Emperor fought in the League War and he:
Won, then he may remove any number of Electors who fought in the Anti-Imperial League from the Electorate, replacing them with Electors of his choice.
Lost, then if a majority of the Players of the Anti-Imperial League agree, they may remove any number of Electors who fought in the Imperial League from the Electorate, replacing them with Electors of their choice.
Finally, members of the Victorious League, in Initiative Order, may conquer provinces from the Defeated League. Target Principalities may neither take provinces nor have their provinces taken during this Peace Treaty. Players do not lose Diplomatic Influence for taking non-adjacent provinces or towns. Otherwise, the rules are the same as those of Peace Treaties during Player Turns.

The Leagues reset – No one starts in either League heading into the next round. Re-shuffle the Military Doctrine Cards.

6. Foreign Powers

Any Non-Foreign Power Player Rounds 1-4 may become a Foreign Power:
Choose a Foreign Power Home Province and place it next to one of the 6 edges of the map of your choice, on the side of the Religion you were in the Empire.
You are not limited by the placement of other Foreign Powers.
Your Foreign Power Home Province is now adjacent to all provinces on that edge of the map for purposes of conversion and Peace Treaties.
Keep your Religion Role Card and any Good Works/Saints; you may no longer convert between religions as a Foreign Power.
Your Foreign Power Home Province is your capital, earns 2 gold per turn, and cannot be conquered or converted; Faith dice may not be placed inside it.
This province grants you a certain amount of Imperial Power, depending on the Round Year (2, 4, 6, 10).
If you have any Town Provinces, release them as Vassals – remove them and replace them with Principalities. Place 2 influence on this Principality.
Then, if you still have more than 4 provinces left, gift them away to adjacent same-religion Principalities, gaining 1 Diplomatic Influence per province gifted.
If there are no eligible Principalities, gift them away to non-adjacent same-religion Principalities. If there are still no eligible Principalities, gift to any Principality, force converting the province.
Then, count the Diplomatic Influence you have saved and on Principalities. Remove it all and give yourself back 1 DI stored on your Foreign Power Home Province for every 2 you had.
Finally, swap all provinces you have remaining inside the Empire with those of a new Principality, with the Principality's capital where yours formerly was and the Principality uniformly the religion of your former capital. Place Diplomatic Influence on this Principality sufficient for you to start as its ally.

If you lost all of your provinces during the Round you immediately become a Foreign Power. Remove the influence you lost due to the war, including any eliminated allies. Lose any Gold you had (you should've used it to not die). Then complete steps 1 and 4. You may participate in a Religious War if one was Declared and were eliminated during Wage War.

7. Imperial Election

Every Round an election is held for who will be the Holy Roman Emperor:

The Emperor is elected by the 7 Electors of the Holy Roman Empire. These start as the 7 historical Electors of this time period – Trier, Mainz, Cologne, Saxony, The Palatinate, Brandenburg, and Bohemia. Throughout the game different Principalities may become Electors, but a Player may never become an Elector.
Only a Player may receive votes for Emperor.
Players allied to Electors control their votes, and may vote for whomever they wish, including themselves and including Players of a different religion from themselves or the Electors whose votes they control.
Any Player may become Emperor, including Foreign Powers.
A Player may not refuse election or re-election.
Players attempt to secure the votes of a majority of the Electors (4) to be elected Emperor. Unaligned Electors vote as a block for the Player of their religion with the most votes after all Players have voted. Initiative/Setup Order between tied Players. If a majority cannot be secured, the Emperor may be elected by a plurality.
Give the newly elected Emperor the Emperor Card and update the Round Year. The Emperor receives 2 Diplomatic Influence, which he stores on his capital Rounds 1-4. The Emperor also at this time reminds any Players who have Gold left over from the Round to turn it into Diplomatic Influence at a rate of 1:1 and place it on their capital. Round 5 the Emperor may place his 2 DI on the board.
