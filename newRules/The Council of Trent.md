%% Until The Catholic Reformation begins, Catholic Players decide whether or not to call The Council of Trent and attempt to begin The Catholic Reformation: %%
 
First, all Catholic players secretly place a Council of Trent or French Interference token in their hands. Reveal simultaneously; if you submitted a Council of Trent token you store up treasure in heaven and gain 1 Good Work - check Role Cards. If you submitted a French Interference token you gain 1 Diplomatic Influence stored on your capital as your worldly reward. If a majority are French Interference tokens, or the Emperor submits a French Interference token, the French interfere and the Council is delayed.

If at least half are Council of Trent tokens, including the Emperor's if he's Catholic, then the Council meets but does not necessarily conclude. Roll the Ottoman Empire die; if it lands on an Ottoman Crescent (1-2), the Ottoman Empire threatens to disrupt the council, which disperses without concluding - better luck next round!

If the Ottoman Empire does not disrupt the Council, then The Council of Trent concludes and The Catholic Reformation begins; Church Abuses end, the Sale of Indulgences is prohibited, and all Catholic Players gain 2 Saints.

%% Saint Pius V & Victory at Lepanto - If the Council has not concluded by the end of Round 2, St. Pius V holds the Council outside the Empire, defeats the Ottoman Empire at Lepanto, and The Catholic Reformation begins anyway. %%
