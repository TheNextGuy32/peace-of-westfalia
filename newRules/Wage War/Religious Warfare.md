1. The Catholic and Evangelical Leagues Form

First, the Declarers of Religious War lose 1 Diplomatic Influence from each Principality they have influence with of the opposing Religion.
Next, in Initiative Order, each Player may Join a League or Decline to Join. Players who Decline to Join lose all DI with the Target Principality(ies).

Players saved by Faith and Works may join the Catholic League only. If they do so, they lose 1 DI from each Protestant Principality they have influence with.

Players saved by Faith Alone may join the Evangelical League only. If they do so, they lose 1 DI from each Catholic Principality they have influence with.

Players not saved by Faith Alone or by Faith and Works may join either League and lose no Diplomatic Influence upon Joining a League.

Finally, the Player with the most Diplomatic Influence (Initiative Order in the case of ties) with each individual Target Principality in its League gains DI with that Target Principality sufficient to become its ally, if not allied already. If no Players in the Target Principality's League have DI with it, then the Player in the Target Principality's League first in Initiative Order becomes its ally.

If there are no Players in the League of the Target Principality(ies), the Declarer(s) of the Religious War win(s) automatically; proceed to the Religious War Peace Treaty phase. If there are Players on both sides, all members in the Catholic League go to war with all members in the Evangelical League; proceed to Religious War Battle phase.

2. Religious War Battle Phase

In a Religious War Battle, follow the standard rules for battle except:

When all Players have drawn their Military Cards and placed their Reserve Tokens, Players separate into their respective Leagues and line up in Initiative Order.

Players pair off and fight separately, with as many Players as possible fighting at once, and those without opponents waiting in line for an opponent 'In Reserve.'

Players only route when they run out of infantry in the face of a cavalry charge or only have cavalry when stopped by pikemen; you do not route if you have Â½ as many Military Cards as your opponent after a cavalry charge, unless you are the last Player remaining in your League and the opposing League combined has 2x the Military Cards as you after you lose a cavalry charge.

When a Player routes, he exits the melee. The victorious Player's army does not return to full strength after winning the engagement, but instead either immediately begins to battle the Player first up 'In Reserve' in the opposing League or, if there are no Players 'In Reserve' in the opposing League, gets in line 'In Reserve.'

3. Religious War Peace Treaty

After the battle, Players in the Defeated League lose all Diplomatic Influence with all Target Principalities. If a Target Principality's League was defeated, it is forcibly converted and the Declarer gains sufficient Diplomatic Influence to become its new ally.

Next, if the Emperor fought in the League War and he:

Won, then he may remove any number of Electors who fought in the Anti-Imperial League from the Electorate, replacing them with Electors of his choice.
Lost, then if a majority of the Players of the Anti-Imperial League agree, they may remove any number of Electors who fought in the Imperial League from the Electorate, replacing them with Electors of their choice.

Finally, members of the Victorious League, in Initiative Order, may conquer provinces from the Defeated League. Target Principalities may neither take provinces nor have their provinces taken during this Peace Treaty. Players do not lose Diplomatic Influence for taking non-adjacent provinces or towns. Otherwise, the rules are the same as those of Peace Treaties during Player Turns.

The Leagues reset - No one starts in either League heading into the next round. Re-shuffle the Military Doctrine Cards.
