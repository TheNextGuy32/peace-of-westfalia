All Players start out 'not saved' with the Catholic State of Mortal Sin Religion Role Card. The Protestant version of this Religion Role Cad is the Predestined to Hell Role Card. Players can 'become saved' by converting to Protestantism or gaining Good Works. Players must take a saved Religion Role Card if they meet the requirements.

The first 2 Players (3 in a 7-8 Player game) to respond to God's irresistible grace and convert to Protestantism take a Saved by Faith Alone Role Card. Once Saved Always Saved - there is nothing you can do to lose this Role Card... except return to Catholicism. If you do so, give your Role Card to the Protestant Predestined to Hell first in Initiative Order. If there are no other Protestants, the next Player to convert to Protestantism gains this role card.

The Catholic Church is slow to respond to the Reformation. Many Catholic responses to Protestantism are gated behind the Council of Trent, and the Catholic Reformation it ushers in. To win, Catholics will need to call a vote to hold the Council.

Win with either a [[Catholic Victory]], [[Protestant Victory]], or [[Peace of Westphalia Victory]].
