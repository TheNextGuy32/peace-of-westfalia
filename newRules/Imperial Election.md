When the Emperor dies, hold an Imperial Election

The Emperor is elected by the 7 Electors of the Holy Roman Empire. These start as the 7 historical Electors of this time period - Trier, Mainz, Cologne, Saxony, The Palatinate, Brandenburg, and Bohemia. Throughout the game different Principalities may become Electors, but a Player may never become an Elector.

Only a Player may receive votes for Emperor.

Players allied to Electors control their votes, and may vote for whomever they wish, including themselves and including Players of a different religion from themselves or the Electors whose votes they control.

A Player may not refuse election or re-election.

Players attempt to secure the votes of a majority of the Electors (4) to be elected Emperor. Unaligned Electors vote as a block for the Player of their religion with the most votes after all Players have voted. Use Initiative/Setup Order to break ties. If a majority cannot be secured, the Emperor is elected by whoever gets the most votes of the players.
